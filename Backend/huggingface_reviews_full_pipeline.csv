I enjoyed this disc. The video is stunning. I agree with others that the story is very dumbed down and takes a childish approach.

"I think that the whole aspect of hitting the road and going on tour with a band is just about the coolest thing that a person can do. Thus, this book seemed like the perfect read for someone like me.

The writing is just not very good and the stories are all lame.

When I found out that it was about a child being born and how her life progressed, I found the work all the more interesting. Some of the songs really stick in your mind.

"Many books on motorcycles abound with glossy pictures but contain little facts. This slim volume by Roland Brown is quite the reverse. The majority of photos are original B&Ws, not staged fashion shots, and there is ample text. It is not a coffee table book, it is a real book! The history begins with Soichiro Honda's start after WWII and traces the company's progress to 1989. For the real motorcyclist there is plenty of technical detail which is used to show the evolution from one machine to the next, rather than being just tabulated facts. The story of the development of motorcycles, as we now know them, and the fascinating saga of a multinational company's growth, make excellent reading. My only complaint is that a book this slim (150 small pages), really doesn't warrant a price tag of $25.

"I'd never read Sandra Brown, and, based on ""The Switch,"" won't look to read more.A potentially interesting plot was ruined by ludicrous dialogue, unbelievable characters, and extremely unlikely plot twists (even allowing for the initial premise). And anyone who was surprised by the ending ought to be ashamed.No, wait. That's not true. Readers who thought early on that they had spotted the ending were encouraged to think otherwise by the fact that in several places Brown refers specifically to Melina out of the context of a conversation. E.g. on page 344 a new chapter section begins: Melina repeated to Chief the half of the conversation that he hadn't overheard. Well, it wasn't Melina, we find at the end, so Brown effectively set up a climax, as it were, that made no sense.Too bad.

"""Death's Deal"" is a fine entry in the solo Raider Western novel series.

Patton did heroic things but there is no need to admire his flaws--and that includes his belief that crude and foul language somehow made him a better man and general, and that he thought he knew more about mental damage than doctors.

"""Rain"" is a classic pre-censorship movie of the 30's. As usual with this type of film, one must do a fair amount of reading between the lines to get the full story. Joan Crawford gives a strong performance as Sadie Thompson, a trollop on the run from the law. Walter Huston as Alfred Davidson, a bible thumping, over the top preacher, is sufficiently scary. The rest of the cast puts in fine performances. The cinematography is also exceptionally elegant.The story is a bit watered down from it's Somerset Maugham original, and some extreme leaps of believability are needed on the part of the audience to accept the denouement. But the story is strong and powerful and surprisingly up-to-date considering it is almost 70 years old. It would seem the religious right has been throwing its muscle around longer than we think.I highly recommend ""Rain"", if for no other reason than to see Joan Crawford in the type of role that made her famous.",rain classic precensorship movie usual type film one must fair amount reading lines get full story joan crawford gives strong performance sadie thompson trollop run law walter huston alfred davidson bible thumping top preacher sufficiently scary rest cast puts fine performances cinematography also exceptionally elegantthe story bit watered somerset maugham original extreme leaps believability needed part audience accept denouement story strong powerful surprisingly uptodate considering almost years old would seem religious right throwing muscle around longer thinki highly recommend rain reason see joan crawford type role made famous,positive,"rain classic, recommend rain, rain",Error: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'

"This story was a huge letdown! Although, I'll admit, this started out to be a page-turner. Which was fast-paced, gory, gruesome, and very intriguing. Just the way I like em, so I thought. But, it didn't seem to want to slowdown, it kept right on going and going, leaving the ending rushed and lacking drama. The story completely dies. No suspense, what so ever, not a typical Patterson novel. And, furthermore, to make things worse, in an effort to pick it back up, which, should've been another story altogether, we discover who's the Mastermind. And, that also is a disappointment.",story huge letdown although ill admit started pageturner fastpaced gory gruesome intriguing way like em thought didnt seem want slowdown kept right going going leaving ending rushed lacking drama story completely dies suspense ever typical patterson novel furthermore make things worse effort pick back shouldve another story altogether discover whos mastermind also disappointment,negative,"patterson novel, ending rushed, novel",Error: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'

"There is no doubt that the man formally known as Harry Houdini led an interesting life. Sprinkled throughout this book are reminders of such. And yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. Events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. Instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in Houdini's life. Relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. Also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. I would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.The book is enjoyable only insomuch as Houdini's life was fascinating.

"We consumed our way into our current mess and it is the height of folly to believe we can consume our way out of it. Privatization (read commodification)is definitely not the answer. The reason the author comes to the conclusions he does is that it is just too difficult for him to give up his current lifestyle. Showing us that recycling doesn't work is easy. Recycling is what happens when we commodify something like garbage, so let's commodify everything and that will solve our other problems just as effectively.

"I enjoyed this book, but I still like Stephen King's The Stand better. The main reason is that the characters in Swan Song did not have enough depth. They were either ""good"" or ""bad."" I would have liked to see some of Swan's bad traits and some of Alvin's good traits, for example. Very few people, if any, are either purely good or purely evil in real life, and I felt that this is where Swan Song lacked credibility. Sometimes I actually felt like cheering for the bad guys because Swan was just too sugary sweet. Other than that, it was a decent book, worth reading.",enjoyed book still like stephen kings stand better main reason characters swan song enough depth either good bad would liked see swans bad traits alvins good traits example people either purely good purely evil real life felt swan song lacked credibility sometimes actually felt like cheering bad guys swan sugary sweet decent book worth reading,positive,"characters swan, liked swans, swan song",Error: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'
