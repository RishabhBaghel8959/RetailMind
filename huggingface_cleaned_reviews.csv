"This product consists of a piece of thin flexible insulating material, adhesive backed velcro and white electrical tape.Problems:1. Instructions are three pictures with little more information.2. Velcro was all crumpled as received and was stronger than the adhesive. When i tried to disengage the velcro both pieces came off and the paint from the ceiling.3. White electrical tape was horrible... cheap, narrow and it fell off in less than 1 hour.4. The price is a ripoff.I am building my own which is easier to use, cheaper, more attractive, and higher r-value. I am surprised Amazon even lists this junk.",product consists piece thin flexible insulating material adhesive backed velcro white electrical tapeproblems instructions three pictures little information velcro crumpled received stronger adhesive tried disengage velcro pieces came paint ceiling white electrical tape horrible cheap narrow fell less hour price ripoffi building easier use cheaper attractive higher rvalue surprised amazon even lists junk

I enjoyed this disc. The video is stunning. I agree with others that the story is very dumbed down and takes a childish approach. It actually seems like its a little one sided and VERY pro-environmental. Nevertheless its enjoyable. I would say however that the Amazon WMV HD disc is a better story and has better and sharper images and more interesting things to look at.,enjoyed disc video stunning agree others story dumbed takes childish approach actually seems like little one sided proenvironmental nevertheless enjoyable would say however amazon wmv hd disc better story better sharper images interesting things look

"I think that the whole aspect of hitting the road and going on tour with a band is just about the coolest thing that a person can do. Thus, this book seemed like the perfect read for someone like me. But when I got the book I was dissapointed in the fact that it seems like the author took five or six stories from the 'The Babysiters Club' or some other book for young kids, rewrote them to include drug and music references, and than sold it. The writing is just not very good and the stories are all lame. A girl's mother realizes her 16 year old daughter is right about being on tour, a girl runs from the cops and gets away, a ticket is fake, ect. Those in themselves aren't even that bad but the way he writes makes it a boring read.",think whole aspect hitting road going tour band coolest thing person thus book seemed like perfect read someone like got book dissapointed fact seems like author took five six stories babysiters club book young kids rewrote include drug music references sold writing good stories lame girls mother realizes year old daughter right tour girl runs cops gets away ticket fake ect arent even bad way writes makes boring read

"First off, I've bought ALL of Tonis other albums. This one took me three listenings to really get to like it. When I found out that it was about a child being born and how her life progressed, I found the work all the more interesting. Some of the songs really stick in your mind. If you see the Album as a story (of a girls life) it makes the Album much more interesting than just listening to the album song by song.Pink Floyd used to do this, have an album which was a theme or story, like The Wall album.I took the CD out of my colection after not listening to it for about 5 months, and have been playing it in my car on the way to work and home for over a week now.It's GREAT.

"Debido a los otros comentarios al respecto de este disco quiero aclarar que Caifanes NO es lo mismo que Jaguares. Son dos grupos diferentes ya que en Caifanes la guitarra estaba en primer plano. El unico pero que le pongo a este CD es que solo incluyeron 2 canciones del MTV Unplugged. Me hubiera gustado que incluyeran todo el MTV unplugged en el segundo disco. Las guitarras de Marcovich se aprecian mas en las versiones en vivo ya que existe la certeza de que no hay ""overdubbing"" (Regrabaciones). Un buen disco para empezar.

"The documentary is typical Ken Burns... interesting, but a little meandering at times.The real shame of this version is the grainy video that is painfully apparent on a large HD display.

"Nina's characters are complex and drawn well, it is evident that she took some time to think about her character's motivations. If I were a writer I might have written the ending differently, but that is okay, my book club talked about this one for awhile. A good exploration of the line between admiring someone and stalking and a bold exploration of the dark side of behavior. If you are looked for a well plotted, interesting story, this is for you.

"A few years back my father got me hooked on this album. It was the first cd I ever owned. An ex-girlfriend liked it so much that after we broke up she declared that cd was not coming with me.I couldn't blame her. The mix of blues and spirituals with Cooder's unique playing makes this one the most intesting albums I own. The medley of ""Feeling Good"" and ""Fool for a Cigarette"" is one of my favorites as well as balads like ""Mexican Divorce"" and ""Jesus on the Main Line"".The album also has some songs that keep it from taking itself too seriously. The song ""If Walls Could Talk"" has a catchy riff and great words.Cooder's great acoustic style shines through on what was a break-through album of the time and holds up years later. I always hear something that I missed on previous listenings.Although you don't need to be a guitar player to appreciate this album, every acoustic player should hear the fine guitar work.

"My wife purchased a Rocket ebook for me for Christmas. She started here at Amazon. She carefully checked the Rocket web site as well, and spoke to the folks that make the Rocket.

It is not mentioned in any documentation that comes with the ebook. It took me more than an hour to get through to the company. At first they responded by saying it was at their Website and/or in the FAQ section, but we ""went to their Web site together"" while I was on the phone, and they reluctantly conceded that they had mislead the public.

"While the subject matter of ""The Last Dive"" is compeling enough to carry its own story line, the author's attempts to interject contrived dialogue is embarrasing and a deteriment to his otherwise skillfull writing.

I came away disliking the ""cowboy-like"" father and son diving team and their tragic demise came as no surprise.

"I really was disappointed in this book. With all the hype I expected it to be filled with revolutionary ideas and recipes for totally green smoothies. There are a few interesting details such as the thought that our diet should more closely resemble chimps. Basically we should eat more greens. Other than that much of it is hard to believe. There is absolutely NO WAY all those people (first name only) were cured of illnesses by drinking one quart of green smoothies. Sorry... but NO WAY. Please, moles and warts just fell off.... That kind of claim is a total turn off. The recipes are plain old one cup of greens with fruit and ice. So basically eating one cup of spinach a day, ground up, will cure diabetes? Way over rated.

"The only reason that I am giving 4 stars is because the author did not list all the victims of Dr. SHipman's unsuspected reign of terror in Lancashire. In his long career, he probably killed at least 200 victims--men, women, children, for no apparent reason until he was stopped by the law. Sadly, I cannot stop thinking about all the victims who had dreams to see Israel, cruise, grow up, or old with their loved ones in Lancashire. Dr. Shipman was supposed to be respected and trusted with their lives; he killed his beloved patients without such motives at all.

"Keith Murray steps out for another dictionary rhyme book tales with another album entitled Enigma. He impressively both used a vocabulary to conversant with scholars and entertained his listeners with tales of adventure with titles like ""World Be Free"" and the heartfelt ""To My Mans"" featuring Dave Hollister. As he begins by antagonizing others on ""Intro"" it continues over to ""Call My Name"" as he dares any competition to contest. ""Dangerous Ground"" featuring 50 Grand is more upbeat than usual for Keith, but his ability to adapt nearly passes by.

I spoke Azeri relatively well once and decided to pick up this little book to revisit the language. Out of the limited amount of literature on the subject I chose this one on a hunch and it's nothing more than a phrase book for a tourist to get around.

"There's not much wrong with this film, but it has changed the way I watch films forever. Previously I had laughed at the misrepresentation of other peoples misery in films, its portrayal as not really being as bad as the sufferer says it is.

But after seeing this film I now feel ashamed and angry at the effect that films can have on the way society thinks of and treats people.Jack Nicholson, if you're going to play a character suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and phobias HAVE THE DECENCY TO RESEARCH THE CONDITION AND PUT SOME EFFORT INTO CONVEYING THE MISERY IT BRINGS, rather than just playing it half-heartedly for laughs.",theres much wrong film changed way watch films forever previously laughed misrepresentation peoples misery films portrayal really bad sufferer says im sure us time another laughed misfortunate medical circumstances others represented film seeing film feel ashamed angry effect films way society thinks treats peoplejack nicholson youre going play character suffering obsessive compulsive disorder phobias decency research condition put effort conveying misery brings rather playing halfheartedly laughs

"except maybe Jeanette Winterson's ""Written on the Body."" I felt deeply pulled in by this novel, which unfolds slowly and bathes you in an incredibly intoxicating, emotional mist. It is highly erotic and engrossing, and one of the only well written and overtly bisexual works of fiction. The only failure here is the ending which becomes a little too melodramatic and (I think) untrue to at least one of the characters. But the quality of language, plot, and character are very, very high. I took it in while I was recovering from a break-up and the relationships in Searle's book were enough to distract me.

It really gave me insights into both life and death. I grew to love the characters and could identify with a lot of things about them.

Macleod obviously is an experienced and careful writer, and his depictions of the town of Bracebridge and the lives of the people there are so well done that I could almost see the individuals he described.That said, though, I was not able to finish the book because the action is so slow moving. Macleod loves his descriptions of the people and the work of removing aether from the ground, but he spends so much time on those depictions that the narrative just creeps along.

I thought that maybe we'd get to experience some of the innovation and originality that Phil had early in his career with early Genesis and his first couple of solo albums, but Simon gives us something that's OK to play in the background yet doesn't hold up to real listening, in my opinion. I'm not intentionally slagging the guy -- it's very apparent that he has talent, but he just doesn't quite have the creative songwriting tools to make it jump out yet.",hoping given simons father seems hes gone cheesefilled road phil eventually thought maybe wed get experience innovation originality phil early career early genesis first couple solo albums simon gives us something thats ok play background yet doesnt hold real listening opinion im intentionally slagging guy apparent talent doesnt quite creative songwriting tools make jump yet

"I bought this game on day one based on the fact that it was a next-gen shadowrun. I read about it and became very excited about the gameplay and the new ideas. But then I actually played it. With all the time, effort and money put into this game, why is there absolutly no single player story mode. This is based on a world with some of the richest history in pen-and-paper rpgs out there. Why could they not even muster up the time to put in even an average single player mode.

"On their debut album, Cheap Trick's masterful pop hooks were cut with a nasty metallic edge that quickly got sanded down on subsequent releases. Rick Nielsen's guitar crackles with a palpable electricity, and the sparse production refuses to add gloss or tidy up in any way. The vocal melodies are Beatlesque in the best sense, made all the more impressive by Robin Zander's uncanny ability to sing like both Lennon and McCartney. There's an adult malevolence at work here that is completely at odds with the harmless cartoon the band became.

"Many books on motorcycles abound with glossy pictures but contain little facts. This slim volume by Roland Brown is quite the reverse. The majority of photos are original B&Ws, not staged fashion shots, and there is ample text. It is not a coffee table book, it is a real book! The history begins with Soichiro Honda's start after WWII and traces the company's progress to 1989. For the real motorcyclist there is plenty of technical detail which is used to show the evolution from one machine to the next, rather than being just tabulated facts. The story of the development of motorcycles, as we now know them, and the fascinating saga of a multinational company's growth, make excellent reading. My only complaint is that a book this slim (150 small pages), really doesn't warrant a price tag of $25.

"I was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. Most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts.

"I liked the book, although I was looking for a much more in depth treatment of the subject. The author consistently stresses that if you choose to be a con artist you will be caught and exhibits some frustration that con artists are not punished more severly than they are, since most con artist crimes are perceived as crimes the victims brought on themselves through their own greed and avarice.The title is somewhat misleading. Don't read this is you want to actually be a con artist as you won't learn too many tricks. There is a detailed explanation on how to short change someone, which I found interesting, but most other con artist tricks are given vague explanations.If you want to know about con artists read this as part of a more extensive study as it does not stand on its own as a resource.",liked book although looking much depth treatment subject author consistently stresses choose con artist caught exhibits frustration con artists punished severly since con artist crimes perceived crimes victims brought greed avaricethe title somewhat misleading dont read want actually con artist wont learn many tricks detailed explanation short change someone found interesting con artist tricks given vague explanationsif want know con artists read part extensive study stand resource

This is not a 5 star film. And I have to agree with Acute Observer in finding this not realistic or believable in many aspects. As flawed as our government is I highly doubt that the FBI would allow a club that hunts young black men to continue on while they look for more evidence. And I found it impossible to believe that Debra Winger's character could continue to love Berenger after discovering that he was a racist murderer. This film is a guilty pleasure- albeit a wierd one. It plays more like a tv movie than a brilliant feature film. It is extremely dated and is written for a junior high or high school level of intellect.,star film agree acute observer finding realistic believable many aspects flawed government highly doubt fbi would allow club hunts young black men continue look evidence found impossible believe debra wingers character could continue love berenger discovering racist murderer film guilty pleasure albeit wierd one plays like tv movie brilliant feature film extremely dated written junior high high school level intellect

"I'd never read Sandra Brown, and, based on ""The Switch,"" won't look to read more.A potentially interesting plot was ruined by ludicrous dialogue, unbelievable characters, and extremely unlikely plot twists (even allowing for the initial premise). And anyone who was surprised by the ending ought to be ashamed.No, wait. That's not true. Readers who thought early on that they had spotted the ending were encouraged to think otherwise by the fact that in several places Brown refers specifically to Melina out of the context of a conversation. E.g. on page 344 a new chapter section begins: Melina repeated to Chief the half of the conversation that he hadn't overheard. Well, it wasn't Melina, we find at the end, so Brown effectively set up a climax, as it were, that made no sense.Too bad.

I have both of Fiona Apple's prior albums and found that this one cannot compare. Maybe she should have stuck with Jon Brion? Maybe there was a reason her record label didn't want to release it?I bought this album based on the title track which I loved when I heard it on the radio, as I felt that this track showed some growth, musically and personally. But the rest of the album seems to lack in melody, direction and substance.

"""Death's Deal"" is a fine entry in the solo Raider Western novel series. This series of books focused on the character of Raider, working alone for the Pinkertons after Doc Weatherbee leaves the agency.Most of the plot is taken up with a grueling cattle drive, which brings out the courage and cowardice, good and evil of everybody involved. The major villain is more of a contemporary sociopath than the standard Western bad guy.The solo Raider books just don't have the quality of the earlier Hardin series, but this one is excellent.Highly recommended.",deaths deal fine entry solo raider western novel series series books focused character raider working alone pinkertons doc weatherbee leaves agencymost plot taken grueling cattle drive brings courage cowardice good evil everybody involved major villain contemporary sociopath standard western bad guythe solo raider books dont quality earlier hardin series one excellenthighly recommended

They are NOT durable...maybe they are more durable then the thinnest Crayola crayon but certainly not the jumbo crayons. The color is so light and barely there, it's not fun for young children. The crayons feel weird and are not at all like the color of the actual crayon when the color is on paper.

"Not only is this a simple, timeless, unisex looking mobile, but it is also great for the development of a baby's vision. Whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. Keep in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for months. The panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. The primary colors of Blue Jean Teddy then become noticed. The green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. My baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. The only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. I would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as I and my baby wanted.

"The Taschen Posterbooks are of excellent quality. The six Van Gogh's given us here, for a very low price, are a nicely representative group.

We like them to the point of hanging all 6 in our home. The images are of the cafe at Arles-night, lane with cypresses, one of the sunflowers, one self-portrait, the bridge at Langlois and of course, the bedroom at Arles.Regardless the amount of money you have to spend, definitely buy this little jewel as an adjunct.

Sure, there might be a few plot holes, but they are not important.

"Think of this album as a genius engineer building a masterfully powerful machine...out of an erector set. 'Selling Live Water' has powerful, very raw and clangy, beats. Sole's voice is that of anger, frustration, and insight, but overall you can really here a guy having fun. He creates incredible lines without using any proper rhyme scheme; his formula is to be dead on with the beats, and at that he is incredible. While Sole's rapping skills cannot be argued with, I must say that the beats are the star of the album. Of all the hip-hop albums to emerge lately this one is 2nd only to El-P's 'Fantastic Damage'. Exceptional songs include 'Da Baddest Poet', 'Salt on Everything', and 'Plutonium'.",think album genius engineer building masterfully powerful machineout erector set selling live water powerful raw clangy beats soles voice anger frustration insight overall really guy fun creates incredible lines without using proper rhyme scheme formula dead beats incredible soles rapping skills cannot argued must say beats star album hiphop albums emerge lately one nd elps fantastic damage exceptional songs include da baddest poet salt everything plutonium

Patton did heroic things but there is no need to admire his flaws--and that includes his belief that crude and foul language somehow made him a better man and general, and that he thought he knew more about mental damage than doctors.

"Irony, agony, and love are the major elements in Peter Hargitai's novel, Atilla: A Barbarian's Love Story. Atilla's struggle to free himself from the shackles of the past customs is an emotional rollercoaster.His post-modern fiction would be appreciated by generations who find themselves agonized by people's rejections of the joining of multicultural societies. Some may criticize the novel for the ordinary love story, however, it's what makes it worthy to read. Peter Hargitai was anything but close-minded about the current ""melting pot"" in America, and this is what the world needs. Even if the beginning may not be in sync with the rest of the book, it's a nice sense of Hungarian history. Despite some technical errors, the overall jist of the novel is enjoyable.",irony agony love major elements peter hargitais novel atilla barbarians love story atillas struggle free shackles past customs emotional rollercoasterhis postmodern fiction would appreciated generations find agonized peoples rejections joining multicultural societies may criticize novel ordinary love story however makes worthy read peter hargitai anything closeminded current melting pot america world needs even beginning may sync rest book nice sense hungarian history despite technical errors overall jist novel enjoyable

"""Rain"" is a classic pre-censorship movie of the 30's. As usual with this type of film, one must do a fair amount of reading between the lines to get the full story. Joan Crawford gives a strong performance as Sadie Thompson, a trollop on the run from the law. Walter Huston as Alfred Davidson, a bible thumping, over the top preacher, is sufficiently scary. The rest of the cast puts in fine performances. The cinematography is also exceptionally elegant.The story is a bit watered down from it's Somerset Maugham original, and some extreme leaps of believability are needed on the part of the audience to accept the denouement. But the story is strong and powerful and surprisingly up-to-date considering it is almost 70 years old. It would seem the religious right has been throwing its muscle around longer than we think.I highly recommend ""Rain"", if for no other reason than to see Joan Crawford in the type of role that made her famous.",rain classic precensorship movie usual type film one must fair amount reading lines get full story joan crawford gives strong performance sadie thompson trollop run law walter huston alfred davidson bible thumping top preacher sufficiently scary rest cast puts fine performances cinematography also exceptionally elegantthe story bit watered somerset maugham original extreme leaps believability needed part audience accept denouement story strong powerful surprisingly uptodate considering almost years old would seem religious right throwing muscle around longer thinki highly recommend rain reason see joan crawford type role made famous

I simply got astonished because all the other musics from this cd are quite so good as ""I like Chopin"". And I finally could get a original version of this classic song, both single edit and the LP version. I only had the remix version from the 90's. I really loved ""Wrap the rock"", ""Gimmick"", ""For Anita"" and ""Telephone Mama"".

"There is no doubt that the man formally known as Harry Houdini led an interesting life. Sprinkled throughout this book are reminders of such. And yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. Events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. Instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in Houdini's life. Relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. Also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. I would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.The book is enjoyable only insomuch as Houdini's life was fascinating.

Very few people, if any, are either purely good or purely evil in real life, and I felt that this is where Swan Song lacked credibility.

The book was a followup to Baum's The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus which told Santa's origins.

With motor homes (and trucks) that have dual wheels it is critical that tire pressures be kept equal and at the proper psi. The Milton S976 is the most accurate gauge I have ever used. Its dual head is small enough to fit into the ports in the stainless wheel covers and makes it easy to reach the stem of the inside tire. You might pay a lot more for a gauge but you can't get anything better. The only down side is the size and weight. You won't be carrying it around in your shirt pocket.,motor homes trucks dual wheels critical tire pressures kept equal proper psi milton accurate gauge ever used dual head small enough fit ports stainless wheel covers makes easy reach stem inside tire might pay lot gauge cant get anything better side size weight wont carrying around shirt pocket

"I love fiction and nonfiction books about Queen Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots, and their century. But this was a real disappointment.

"I got this book when I just learned to play the prelude 1 c major, and thought I would look into others later, even though the majority of those preludes and fugues are far beyond my ability to play. Since then I have tried to play prelude 2 (I) and prelude 24 (II) that is extremly beautiful though not easy to play, and I have listened all preludes and some fugues from CD or midi files with this book opened in front of me. I realized how great Bach's music is. Only complaint is that the cover of the book isn't glued strong enough, which is now seperated from the content pages already after only a short period use. Also, the prelude 1 (book I) is probably the correct version, but I have seen from some other books the other version with an extra measure between bar 22 and 23. I now play it with the extra measure since it seems making sense to me.",got book learned play prelude c major thought would look others later even though majority preludes fugues far beyond ability play since tried play prelude prelude ii extremly beautiful though easy play listened preludes fugues cd midi files book opened front realized great bachs music complaint cover book isnt glued strong enough seperated content pages already short period use also prelude book probably correct version seen books version extra measure bar play extra measure since seems making sense

"This movie was well produced and has a beautiful, semi-fantastical setting (almost more like a village in France than India). The acting and cinematography were both very interesting, with some beautiful shots. However, it lacked the light-hearted comedy and story that attracts independent American viewers. My wife and I love seeing Indian movies about the conflicts between traditional Indian society and modernity. In these movies, the family is both part of the plot and oftentimes comic relief. However, I didn't laugh once during this film. It's a serious love story, but mixed with the dancing and fairy tale setting, it's hard to take seriously.A related problem is that this movie simply had too much singing and dancing. I know Bollywood movies tend to have a lot of singing and dancing, but at times this movie seemed to have more music video scenes than plot. I ended up fast-forwarding these sequences.",movie well produced beautiful semifantastical setting almost like village france india acting cinematography interesting beautiful shots however lacked lighthearted comedy story attracts independent american viewers wife love seeing indian movies conflicts traditional indian society modernity movies family part plot oftentimes comic relief however didnt laugh film serious love story mixed dancing fairy tale setting hard take seriouslya related problem movie simply much singing dancing know bollywood movies tend lot singing dancing times movie seemed music video scenes plot ended fastforwarding sequences

"Just FYI: This review is for the 2nd Edition boxed set, not the D&D3; hardcover.There is much to the old axiom of 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it', and as cliche as it might be, it holds very true to the 2nd Edition Forgotten Realms boxed set. Oversized text and space wasting boarder art notwithstanding, the 2nd Ed boxed set incorporates all of the nonsense of the 'Time of Troubles' trilogy of novels. It also adjusts the Dale Reckoning time line by almost a hundred years for no reason. It gives scant overviews of too large of an area, and almost nothing on the things that really matter, like characters, noble houses, and rivalries between states. It also brings out the worst of the Realms, like munchkin characters such as Drizzt Du'Urden and Elminster.

"I will admit upfront that I have not read nor will I read this book. But let me say this about R.C.

"""Shane"" is deservedly known as one of the great Westerns.""Shane"" is the story of a gunfighter who comes to the aid of a family of settlers who are being persecuted by free-rangers.

"This is one of the best Ninja books I've read! Kirtland Peterson describes in depth why the public still views ninjas as violent, deadly, assassins. He describes other various ninja stereotypes. There is a lot of ninja history in this book. Kirtland refers to Masaaki Hatsumi, Stephen K. Hayes, Jack E. Hoban, Bud Malmstrom, Glenn J. Morris, and Christopher Hunter/Ashida Kim. Stephen Hayes does a excellent foreword in this book. I won't spoil the rest of book for you. If you like this book, I suggest reading anything by Masaaki Hatsumi, Stephen K. Hayes, Jack E.

"OK I understand everyone's point of view in thier comparisons between the stage production and the movie. I've heard both soundtracks. Personally I prefer the newer one because I can relate to it. Music was never about what notes a person can hit or how well trained they are. It is about the emotion it inspires. I don't feel as much in the original cast production. It just seems more realistic that the Phantom should sound more seductive to express why Christine would be torn between him and pretty boy. I really enjoyed Gerry's singng because when he sang I knew how he felt. That's the point isn't it?I prefered Emmy as well. Sarah had a tendency to make the words less understandable in order to make her training more evident.I went and saw the movie almost a week ago and still have the music there, inside my mind.I definitly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the story and thinks the Phantom should be dark and more mysterious than he was portrayed prevoiusly.",ok understand everyones point view thier comparisons stage production movie ive heard soundtracks personally prefer newer one relate music never notes person hit well trained emotion inspires dont feel much original cast production seems realistic phantom sound seductive express christine would torn pretty boy really enjoyed gerrys singng sang knew felt thats point isnt iti prefered emmy well sarah tendency make words less understandable order make training evidenti went saw movie almost week ago still music inside mindi definitly recommend anyone enjoys story thinks phantom dark mysterious portrayed prevoiusly

"This album is a huge departure from The Sea and Cake's previous album, Oui. On Oui, the songs were very warm, the synthesizers were used to support the traditional rock instruments. On One Bedroom, the songs, while still engaging, are more electronic and alien. The guitar steps aside for the synthesizer, and the drum machines seem to appear more than the drum set. The division between songs that center on more traditional rock arrangements and more electronic compositions is actually pretty equal. What's amazing is that the album is cohesive enough to make the instrumental songs flow seamlessly with the heavily electronic songs. Not only do the songs flow well on this album, the cover of David Bowie's ""Sound + Vision"" makes sense next to the original compositions.

The movie centers around three women, Virginia Wolfe, played by a hard-to-recognize Nicole Kidman; an unhappy young housewife from the 50's, played by Julianne Moore; and a modern-day woman played by Meryl Streep. Their stories interweave with one another and there are common themes of mental illness, lesbianism and unhappy women with death wishes. Not exactly light entertainment!

"I found this book rather sentimental and unsubtle, at least too much so for my taste. More importantly, I don't think this book is really for children. I don't think kids will relate to the father's emotion about his daughter, or simply may not perceive it: 'And he was smiling' may not be enough for kids. It doesn't help that the father is never depicted -- makes it harder still to identify with or understand this important character. And once the girl becomes a woman, I'm afraid that kids will feel very separate from her and so again not feel the deep emotion that many adults feel. This author has lots of fans, and many will enjoy the book no matter what, but in my opinion, as a children's book, it's flawed.",found book rather sentimental unsubtle least much taste importantly dont think book really children dont think kids relate fathers emotion daughter simply may perceive smiling may enough kids doesnt help father never depicted makes harder still identify understand important character girl becomes woman im afraid kids feel separate feel deep emotion many adults feel author lots fans many enjoy book matter opinion childrens book flawed

"In this comeback of the Teen Titans, Starfire invites the teen sidekicks of the DC Universe to reform the teen-powered super team. As expected with teen sidekicks, they are all anxious to get out of the shadows of their mentors. Of course if the Teen Titans return, their nemesis Deathstroke will show up. In fact, the battle between the Teen Titans and Deathstroke is the highlight of this book as the young heroes pit their skills against the wily mercenary. Surprisingly, the Teen Titans also go up against the JLA! Since Wonder Girl joined the Titans without Wonder Woman's approval, Wonder Woman shows up to enforce her wishes.

"Do you like books that you absolutely cannot put down? Then Frindle by Andrew Clements is the book for you! This book is about a boy named Matt who has to do a homework assignment about how the words in a dictionary were made. While he is doing the report, he learns that words are just made up for no particular reason, so he makes up his own his own word instead of a pen he calls it a frindle. After a few weeks, the whole town is saying the word. I liked this book because it is funny and realistic. This book would be better for people under thirteen because I don't think people over thirteen will think it is funny. I say that because it will only take adults about 45min. to read this book.

"This is a piece of junk - the cars are supposed to hook together and be able to be dragged along by an 18 month old. The problem with this is, the cars don't LATCH together (they don't click into place) - they just set one car upon another. This means that when the child tries to pull the cars, he or she just ends up pulling the front car out, dumping the Winnie the Pooh character on the floor, and swinging the front car in the air. The ONLY way to get this to roll along on the floor is to pull the string along, parallel to the floor. The only child you could convince to do that would be older than 2, if not 3.

"Joss Stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. I couldn't find a single memorable tune here. I also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, ""Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew."" I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's ""The Orange Album"" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut. Had Gwen Stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. It's new artists like Stefy that could keep the music business afloat.
