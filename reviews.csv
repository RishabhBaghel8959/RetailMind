review
"This product consists of a piece of thin flexible insulating material, adhesive backed velcro and white electrical tape.Problems:1. Instructions are three pictures with little more information.2. Velcro was all crumpled as received and was stronger than the adhesive. When i tried to disengage the velcro both pieces came off and the paint from the ceiling.3. White electrical tape was horrible... cheap, narrow and it fell off in less than 1 hour.4. The price is a ripoff.I am building my own which is easier to use, cheaper, more attractive, and higher r-value. I am surprised Amazon even lists this junk."
"Even on the lowest setting, the toast is too dark for my liking. Also, the on light stays lit so you have to unplug it to avoid wasting electricity. Not the quality I expected from Cuisinart."
I enjoyed this disc. The video is stunning. I agree with others that the story is very dumbed down and takes a childish approach. It actually seems like its a little one sided and VERY pro-environmental. Nevertheless its enjoyable. I would say however that the Amazon WMV HD disc is a better story and has better and sharper images and more interesting things to look at.
"The authors pretend that parents neither die nor divorce. Insisting the marriage is the rock upon which all else (behavior, well-being of the child) is built, they send a clear message to non-traditional households: this book is for people who play the game of life our way only, and everyone else can suffer the bad behavior they deserve to."
"Might as well just use a knife, this product holds next to nothing. I found it to be a useless product."
"I think that the whole aspect of hitting the road and going on tour with a band is just about the coolest thing that a person can do. Thus, this book seemed like the perfect read for someone like me. But when I got the book I was dissapointed in the fact that it seems like the author took five or six stories from the 'The Babysiters Club' or some other book for young kids, rewrote them to include drug and music references, and than sold it. The writing is just not very good and the stories are all lame. A girl's mother realizes her 16 year old daughter is right about being on tour, a girl runs from the cops and gets away, a ticket is fake, ect. Those in themselves aren't even that bad but the way he writes makes it a boring read."
"I saw these movies originally in the theater, loved both and ordered them because I wanted to have it in my collection. I ordered it twice and neither of the DVDs worked. I would think you would check your merchandise before sending it out. I am so disappointed and can't believe that you could send out two defective DVDs and had not solved the problem after the first one plus some of the complaints I have read in the reviews. I am rating this with one star because of the quality of the DVD, not the films.Colleen"
"Would not fit my new Optima HD20 projector -- as projectors get smaller the mounting holes get closer together -- this mount had four arms and the projector had three -- the mount had arms that would not get short enough to reach the three projector holes -- for larger projectors may work better, but for mine would not recommend -- returning it was very easy and the company representatives very helpful -- so if you get it and it doesn't work, the company is easy to work with --"
"This is a great cd!!!!!!!!! It is the normal oops! cd plus three cool new songs. Also there are lots of added extras that are inhansed on the cd, for example you get the lucky video, a fact file, and a britney unscrambler!!!!! The three bonus tracks are really nice but I wish that they could have been a little more up tempo. Just to clear something up it says in the discription that there is an exclusive oops preformance but there isn't!"
"The handle broke clean off after TWO WEEKS. Not the plastic part, actually at the weld where the metal meets the pan. Wasn't overheated, wasn't abused, used 4 times and broke."
"This was a stunning book. Well written, packed with fascinating detail, I wish I had ten more like it to turn to. Anyone looking for an inside view of a part of China's history would do well to pick up this book. It was a wonderful read."
"This book just gives you the basics unfortunately. Was not very helpful, I would suggest just doing research on the interweb instead."
This book does not convey much of anything. Save your time and money. Read Searching for Bobby Fischer. The details and honesty are lacking in this made for MTV summary of kindergartener makes good.
"First off, I've bought ALL of Tonis other albums. This one took me three listenings to really get to like it. When I found out that it was about a child being born and how her life progressed, I found the work all the more interesting. Some of the songs really stick in your mind. If you see the Album as a story (of a girls life) it makes the Album much more interesting than just listening to the album song by song.Pink Floyd used to do this, have an album which was a theme or story, like The Wall album.I took the CD out of my colection after not listening to it for about 5 months, and have been playing it in my car on the way to work and home for over a week now.It's GREAT. And I'm not a female by the way.Nice ALbum. If you like Tonis other works,.....GET IT."
"the scratch resistant screen guard protector is fit perfectly on the screen of HTC cingular 8125. Quality of the screen guard protector is very good. only negative point is high shipping charge. it cost me $4.99 as shipping for buying this item which cost $ 3.49 amazon has to reduce the shipping charge, or reduce the shipping charge for combined items. any way best buy."
I couldn't even finish the book. I got about half way through and realized I wasn't paying attention and didn't care. Nothing like Harry Potter - not fun at all. I can't recommend this at all!
We were given this book as a shower gift before our kids were born and I was somewhat skeptical but it has turned out to be a favorite. Our daughter loves to name the animals and their sounds and has learned her colours from these wonderful books. The pictures are just right as is the wonderful text that is just enough repetition that she 'gets it' to participate with the reading. A great asset to your children's library... or shower gift for those people who have everything already!
"Having received this video as a gift, we watched it as a family, accompanied by a lot of laughter and ""I didn't know that"". The kids managed to show this to most of their friends, the youngest even taking it to school where his 1st grade teacher used it as a part of her unit on Careers.The video is an overall winner. Anyone, any age, will enjoy the playful and informative story and all will come away with a greater understanding and respect for both the lobster and the lobsterman. BUY IT!"
This book is used by many marriage counselors. But I believe if you are getting married this book should be required reading. It provides true insight to what makes us tick and how to keep the fire burning bright which should be every expecting to be couple's heart desire.
"Listened to this CD closely for the first time in a while. I've forgotten how outstanding this CD is. While I have not heard Pure, I have ordered it hoping it that will be anything close to this CD - and hopefully far away from Dead Inside which is a whole different planet. Great vocals, great music, great lyrics, it has it all."
"Debido a los otros comentarios al respecto de este disco quiero aclarar que Caifanes NO es lo mismo que Jaguares. Son dos grupos diferentes ya que en Caifanes la guitarra estaba en primer plano. El unico pero que le pongo a este CD es que solo incluyeron 2 canciones del MTV Unplugged. Me hubiera gustado que incluyeran todo el MTV unplugged en el segundo disco. Las guitarras de Marcovich se aprecian mas en las versiones en vivo ya que existe la certeza de que no hay ""overdubbing"" (Regrabaciones). Un buen disco para empezar. Estoy seguro que si este es el primer disco de Caifanes que se adquiere pronto nacera la curiosidad por conocer las canciones que no se incluyen de los otros discos."
This book has two stories writen at the same time. In the original pbook format one story was written in left pages and the other in the right pages. But this is all lost in the Kindle and its very complicated to follow the story. I can not uderestand how they dare to sell a product not propared to be used properlly by its readers.
"The documentary is typical Ken Burns... interesting, but a little meandering at times.The real shame of this version is the grainy video that is painfully apparent on a large HD display. Burns' panned still images are crystal clear showing every blemish and fold of the old photographs but his shots of the majestic scenery in the parks are marred by his poor choice of camera and film. I will say the soundtrack is fairly well done even if Peter Coyote (narrator) is a little dry.Do not bother with the blu ray version, you will not get anything more than the standard DVD version with this series."
"This book is nowhere near as good as the the first series! It SERIOSLY LACKS EXEMENT!In other words don't buy it, if you really want to read it, get it from the libray. I would not recomend it to anybody."
"""WITNESS"" is about Ford and an Amish boy who witnesses a murder. Now, the Amish don't beleive in killing and guns - and to have their child see that sort of stuff is just terrible. Now, men who were involved in the murder are out to murder THE AMISH BOY! Suspenseful and red - blooded, ""WITNESS"" is an awsome film! I loved it and I bet anyone will, too! ENJOY!"
"Nina's characters are complex and drawn well, it is evident that she took some time to think about her character's motivations. If I were a writer I might have written the ending differently, but that is okay, my book club talked about this one for awhile. A good exploration of the line between admiring someone and stalking and a bold exploration of the dark side of behavior. If you are looked for a well plotted, interesting story, this is for you. It is not one of those books with lots of sex and no plot as you might think at first. I was pleasantly surprised and look forward to whatever Ms. Foxx has up her sleeve next."
I've saved a lot of space by hanging my shoes up with this. For heavier shoes you have to use more than one hanger though
"A few years back my father got me hooked on this album. It was the first cd I ever owned. An ex-girlfriend liked it so much that after we broke up she declared that cd was not coming with me.I couldn't blame her. The mix of blues and spirituals with Cooder's unique playing makes this one the most intesting albums I own. The medley of ""Feeling Good"" and ""Fool for a Cigarette"" is one of my favorites as well as balads like ""Mexican Divorce"" and ""Jesus on the Main Line"".The album also has some songs that keep it from taking itself too seriously. The song ""If Walls Could Talk"" has a catchy riff and great words.Cooder's great acoustic style shines through on what was a break-through album of the time and holds up years later. I always hear something that I missed on previous listenings.Although you don't need to be a guitar player to appreciate this album, every acoustic player should hear the fine guitar work. Enjoy!"
I ordered this bread machine for a vacation home that we own. I have a Cuisinart at my year-round home and it just has too many bells and whistles that I never use - and cost a lot more. The Sunbeam makes a great dough and was a great price.
"My wife purchased a Rocket ebook for me for Christmas. She started here at Amazon. She carefully checked the Rocket web site as well, and spoke to the folks that make the Rocket. She was assured that everything required to use the Rocket with a Mac was included. Wrong! Any Mac currently being made or made during the past year or so requires a Keyspan connector between the e-book and the Mac USB slot. This costs $80. It is not mentioned in any documentation that comes with the ebook. It took me more than an hour to get through to the company. At first they responded by saying it was at their Website and/or in the FAQ section, but we ""went to their Web site together"" while I was on the phone, and they reluctantly conceded that they had mislead the public. The company does literature. Guide provided on the ebook. Regardless of how much I may eventually enjoy this toy, I'll never develop a high regard for NuvoMedia, which makes the Rocket ebook."
"Upon receipt it was dead, after a mixture of e-mailes and phone calls it was determined I needed to use 2 USB cables to power the drive. Since I only have 2 on my laptop, I cant print from the drive. after transfering 10 gig of pictures and 13 gig of mp3's the unit failed the next month. Again emails and phone calls determined my laptop did not have enough power to run the drive. The solution was an AC adapter.....great for a ""portable USB drive"" They said an AC adaptor would be sent...no adapter after 4 weeks now. I tried the drive on 4 other DESKTOPS, plenty of USB power, but no luck. I have lost so much information, pictures, and music and now no emails refering to my ""service number"" are being answered at all.A total lack of customer servive AND knolage of their own product. Think long and hard before dealing with Iogear!!"
"I just got my DVD in today and I tried to watch it but there seems to be nothing on both discs, I have tried it in my DVD player and my computer, nothing is on both discs, nothing will load, I got robbed.If there were something on both discs, i'd give it a high rating, but for now, all i'll give is one star."
It is a nice car - better than a already made car - your son will have fun assemble it will even do some changes and when he finish he can continue playing as if it were a standard car.
"This is a horrible disc, all of the songs, save one or two, have been reworked. If your looking for a cd to hear bygone favorites, as they were originally done, this is not the disc."
Have used this and it definitely gets u going to the potty!! Bye bye water weight! I just don't like that it has to steep for a while...I am impatient.
All of James Patterson's books (Women's Murder Club) have kept me in suspense. I would be glad to say that it have been a thrill to read them
I'm sick of everyone saying Ashlee has no talent. If she had no talent she wouldn't have a record deal. She is only 19 and talks about 19 year old things. People seem to forget that she has been on tv for 2 years and that is why people already know her. I appreciate her music b/c it is her music. She's more than many musicians today-she's writing the lyrics rather than singing other people's songs. The album is good. Quit putting her down and appreciate her for her hard work! She sings a lot better than other musicians you all like!
"I'm a pilot, and I'm giving up on this product. I've been trying to use it, calibrate it, get it to respond somewhat close to the way a real aircraft responds, and it just doesn't work. It is possible I'm doing something wrong, but it should not take several hours of trying to figure out the right way. I've reduced sensitivity to zero and it still won't respond realistically."
"Movie had a great story, but filming methods of that time was not that great. I enjoyed the movie mostly because I had met the stars when they were in Colorado Springs during the filming of some of the movie.I purchased this movie from Amazon."
I bought this for my daughter when she was almost 2yrs. and she loved it from the start. The music is a little annoying but that is my problem not hers. She has stood on top of it and it has been dropped down the stairs and it still works fine!I would definalty reccomend this toy!
I was disappointed with this book. Since it said Hallelujah on the cover I though it was raw food recipes. I will be giving it away for a gift when I need something for a gift the next time.This book should of never been put with the Hallelujah diet book.
"Actually, I thought I had ordered the CD of the TV show. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Amazom staff admitted that the pics on the sell page were misleading. We've listened and it's not worth much. Curious how a TV sound track can be so engaging and another CD so trite and shallow. Buyer beware."
"I bought this neck strap WITH my camera, thinking I would be insane not to have a strap to put around my neck.I learned, however, that it really isn't necessary. The Elphs are so tiny that they EASILY fit into your pocket. The other option is to wind the included wrist strap around your wrist. They're so lightweight that you barely notice they're there."
"If you love the sport of curling, do not watch this movie! The acting is just okay. Don't let your kids watch this movie as there is a lot of profanity in it. The movie isn't awful, but it isn't good either. The curling action is not realistic."
"After my last Panasonic Shaver mysteriously disappeared when I moved across the country, I decided to try this one, since the price was so cheap I wouldn't be kicking myself if the other shaver is rediscovered in a moving box somewhere. I have been very pleased with it, and love shaving in the shower with it. Like others, I have found that the neck area requires a little more attention and a few extra passes to get the job done, but well worth it for a close shave with no bleeding. It took over a month for the product to be delivered from Amazon, since they were out of stock when I ordered."
"This UPS never worked from day one when I pluged it up.The lcd display only comes on when it's working off the battery,and I cant get it to charge the battery because it seems like its not seeing the power source it just doesn't work."
"Within 20 minutes these candles were completely melted and now my carpet is a mess. More for decoration and with that being the case, these candles are too expensive for what your getting."
"A friend gave me a copy of ""Dresden"" and I watched it many times before giving it back and ordering my own copy. I watched the movie several times for different reasons: 1. History, 2. View from the German side, 3. View from the British side, 4. Acting skills. I love the movie, am impressed with F. Woll's in the main role. I think some scenes were too Hollywood, loved the honesty of the script, not too much violence, but one can start to feel the horror of the bombings and being trapped in cellars and on the ground by the devastating fires. I was a mistake, a big one, History was destroyed as it often is in wars. Did the Germans deserve this so much emotionally human reaction? Yes and No. Not only the Germans or the people of Dresden lost a jewel."
"I agree with the kids review below. This album along with all of their others is garbage. They just keep putting out the same album over and over.Do you really think in 10, 20, even 30 years, people are going to be playing Nickelback CDs and saying, ""Wow they were a great band""? Who goes around blasting Creed, Poison, Cinderella, Ratt, or C&C; Music Factory? This band will be forgotten just like these others.It's textbook rock ballad garbage with no thought or feeling put into the song writing. They have found a formula that somehow sells records and so they've stuck with it. Watch their live performances with Chad's gay permed haircut. Someone should take their instruments away so they won't poison rock music anymore."
"This is the epitome of a ""B"" western movie, but it's hilarious! Andy Griffith, Tom Berrenger, Marilou Henner and Selma Ward--all of them did a great job on this!"
"These are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. They have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. The fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. Very few of these were broken during shipping. I definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. They are a low-calorie, low-fat snack. Yummy!"
"Polk Audio RM6750 5.1 Channel Home Theater Speaker System, Black FinishI have been using this speaker system for about a year with a Sony STR-DG810. I am very pleased with the performance of this package especially at the price point. My friends and family have all been impressed remarking that the system sounds like a movie theater. Bass from sub-woofer is deep and powerful and the center speaker reproduces dialoge beautifully. What is also nice, Polk sells seperate surround speakers so I can make a 6.1 system since my Sony receiver has that capability. Don't worry if you are thinking about RM6750, I have enjoyed mine from the start!"
"VA 1/2 inch rotaty files and rasps are not 1/2 inch in diameter. They can be up to 1/16 smaller depending on product number. ie: 16671 is labeled 12.7 mm, yet VA's spec is 12.0 mm, and 16674 is labeled 12.7 mm, yet VA's spec is 11.6 mm"
"I first saw Kentucky Fried Movie when I was 17 years old. I am now 51. A friend of mine mentioned a line from the movie and it was so funny that I went online to buy this movie to show my son and also to see it again with my friends now. It is made up of little skits that are all funny. Maybe a little silly also, but still a good movie to hang out and watch."
"Like Strayhorn and the Duke, Gil really found someone he could bounce off in the shape of Brian Jackson. His earlier stuff is pure gold, but very droney sometimes... BUT THIS!!!This I never tire of. The songs still sound so vibrant and fresh.The live version of 'home is where the hatred is' has been sampled by masters @ work, and is a muso's dream to get into.'Hello Sunday hello road is one of the grooviest tracks around, and you just can fail to move along and understand the message of 'It's your world.' My Mum used to have the LP, Secrets, with the cats face on the cover. Angel dust is a spacey reincarnation of whats it's like to trip out on the stuff, and the lyrics to showbusiness are more relevent today than ever before.This is one of the best and most valuble compilations of Gils to come out, and is an essential purchase for and funkster and poet."
"Jedis are great and all, but I really enjoy the war aspect of this series. Vol 1 was good, Vol 2 started really picking up in the last section, and Vol 3 really gets to it--War! Its the volumes like this one that make me wish they had a series devoted to Clone Troopers, Republic Commandos, and ARCs (esp Alpha). Good inking and artwork. Straight-forward plot, almost near constant action, and it was good to see the Republic actually defeated here. Nice character development for Anakin. This volume has been my favorite so far...looking forward to getting Vol 4."
"I've been to yoga classes where you get more of a workout than this one. This is more like a stretching exercise. My complaint is a lot of the stretches seemed to repeat many times. The equipment required for use to follow the exercise like the block, straps are kinda specialised items you'd have to buy. I tried to substitue with items I can find at home like a step stool, and rope.For a real workout, I prefer the Perfect Pregnancy workout dvd with Karyne Steben."
"This movie could have been good, but the acting was SO bad I turned it off after 20 minutes (I can't even believe I watched it that long) I was hoping something would change, the plot was a good, but COULD not even get into any of the characters. I don't recommend this movie."
this item make's my bathroom look like you don't want to leave the room.i wish there were other item's to match the seat. thank you!
"The first single from this album is called ""Through the Rain"". It's like Old Mariah only even better. This is a beautiful ballad which has a similiar theme to ""Hero"" or ""Can't Take That Away"", but is even more incredible. If you liked ""old"" mariah, you will want this album. She does have rappers on it, but they aren't the main focus. It's such a beatiful song and I have heard soooooooooo many good things about this album ~ and not just from fans but from critics too! Go to her official site to listen to Through the Rain http://www.mariahcarey.com"
"While the subject matter of ""The Last Dive"" is compeling enough to carry its own story line, the author's attempts to interject contrived dialogue is embarrasing and a deteriment to his otherwise skillfull writing. Chowdhury would have been well advised to simply tell the story and not try to animate it with guessed-at dialogue. I came away disliking the ""cowboy-like"" father and son diving team and their tragic demise came as no surprise. Chowdhury's techincal explanations and descrption of the history of the sport are very good. Unfortunately his fictionalizing of the varous conversations is more cartoon than clever."
"This was a horrible book!Anthony is a sadistic pedophiliac who had been ""watching [the heroine] from afar"". He had even gone so far as to have her tutored in a language he wanted her to speak.It sickened me that the character was made to fall in love with her rapist.""Love"" does not justify rape or whipping a woman or any of the other sick things in this book."
"The unit itself seems to be a good unit. However... it is a terrible device for using in Windows 7 Pro. There are no drivers for it, and you can't not get customer support to answers to your correspondence, for it. So if your going to try to use it in Windows 7... for now, for get it."
"I bought the duck for my 5 pound poodle and it became his favorite toy. The sound of the duck scared him though, but the great part is if they don't like it you can just remove it and they still love just the plush toy. It's perfect for even the smallest dogs and can easily be carried around and played with. The design makes it easy for small dogs to get their mouths around to pick up. I would not recommend this for very destructive dogs though as the limbs might get torn off."
"I enjoy romance novels. I do not enjoy reading about a woman who is abducted, continually raped, impregnated, and then FALLS IN LOVE with her rapist. I kept reading hoping that he would get his just dessert. But he didn't. She falls in love with him and he gets ""reformed."" ????? The whole time all I could think was--this is called Stockholm Syndrome! I was horrified that this was considered a romance. The rape scenes were graphic and, in many cases, violent.Johanna Lindsey should be ashamed of herself for making rape romantic. It is horrible. DO NOT READ!!!"
"I really was disappointed in this book. With all the hype I expected it to be filled with revolutionary ideas and recipes for totally green smoothies. There are a few interesting details such as the thought that our diet should more closely resemble chimps. Basically we should eat more greens. Other than that much of it is hard to believe. There is absolutely NO WAY all those people (first name only) were cured of illnesses by drinking one quart of green smoothies. Sorry... but NO WAY. Please, moles and warts just fell off.... That kind of claim is a total turn off. The recipes are plain old one cup of greens with fruit and ice. So basically eating one cup of spinach a day, ground up, will cure diabetes? Way over rated. I read it in one night and it is definitely not something I would want to keep as a reference for anything. Get it out of the library."
"The only reason that I am giving 4 stars is because the author did not list all the victims of Dr. SHipman's unsuspected reign of terror in Lancashire. In his long career, he probably killed at least 200 victims--men, women, children, for no apparent reason until he was stopped by the law. Sadly, I cannot stop thinking about all the victims who had dreams to see Israel, cruise, grow up, or old with their loved ones in Lancashire. Dr. Shipman was supposed to be respected and trusted with their lives; he killed his beloved patients without such motives at all. The book is an easy read unless you're trying to find out the victims and give them a proper memorial. This book is for those victims and their families! Maybe we can learn from what happened in Lancashire!"
"The characters never really fully develop and, it's a dark miserable story with people running, crying, screaming, at times you need to stop and say to yourself what's going on. I felt nothing for him as a character neither did I feel anything for any of them, I wasn't socked I was bored.It's OK to watch on an airplane ride so you can fall asleep...from 1 to 10 I give a 5"
"I was very excited about this book, until my baby died of SIDS. I think it has some great info. on breastfeeding, etc., but the chapter on SIDS is simply incorrect.The author, like Dr. Sears, is a huge bed sharing advocate. The US Comsumer Product Safety Commission, just concluded a 8 year study that strongly advises against bed sharing to reduce SIDS. The American Academy of Pediactrics and US Public Health Svc. back up this study. Since our loss, it's important to me that the correct info. gets circulated. See the SIDS Alliance web page for more information about SIDS."
"This is a really nice accessory for any photographer. It fully supports my ""tweener"" camera even while fully zoomed. It is extremely lightweight and durable. The strap is a great feature - I have strapped the tripod to railings, benches, tree branches, etc. It is easy to attach to my camera and has complete range of motion. I take it with me every time I grab my camera."
"this is a Compilation that you can share with your Love One or just chill to.the isley Brothers,Intruders,Sly&The Family Stone,Tyrone Davis,Gladys Knight&the Pips among others make this a very Soulful Collection."
"I ordered this to accompany the Pimsleur Language Russian program, as Pimsleur, although very powerful for learning to speak, has little more than a pamphlet to teach you to read. So, I picked this up, and it is very handy. It has made the process of learning to read fairly easay and enjoyable.I would have rated this a 3, however, because you lose a LOT of the meat of the book if you don't have the audio recordings, which aren't included in the book. At least, they weren't with mine. However, I poked around online and found that they're available for download off this website:http://mllc.utsa.edu/troika/student/mp3.htmI don't know how long that site will be up, but if you intend to use this book to teach yourself to read and speak, those MP3s will be invaluable."
"Heart pendant does not look as pretty as in the picture, there's this gold topaz covering on both sides that totally ruins the look of the normal Swarovski crystal, in other words, no colors shine at all. Same thing in on other sites for like $1. Speedy delivery was the only positive."
"I love the compactness of this waterpik. I had the larger one and this one is far more convenient. You don't have to invert the reservoir and the power of the jet is actually stronger than the bigger model. Granted, the smaller amount of liquid in the reservoir was a little disappointing, but I just keep another cup ready to refill it while I am still using the pik. It is definitely easy to use and, of course, that means it will be used more often and the check ups at the dentist attest to the positive impact it has. I most often use a salt & warm water solution and it works great."
"I make candles and export them for a living. I read a lot of wax candle and gel candle making books ... ! It doesn't fit for anyone one at all, be it an amateur or an intermediate level crafter. Believe me, it's best for you to avoid buying this book. It's not worth your money and time reading."
"This CD IS TERRIBLE!!!! IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN THE COMMERCIAL FOR ""KIDS BOP"" ITS ALMOST THE SAME THING!!! NONE OF THE ORIGANAL ARTISTS!!! ALL DONE BY ""THE HIT CREW"" !!! THE TITLE OF THE PAGE SAYS ""VARIOUS ARTISTS"" WHICH MEANS MANY DIFFERENT ARTISTS AND IT WAS ALL ONE STUPID BAND CALLED ""THE HIT CREW""!!! DONT BUY IT!!! IT IS TERRIBLE!!!"
Granddaughter is not very good at reading music so I hope this book will help guide her when she needs it.
"I can't understand all of the good reviews for this film, which I found to be a huge disappointment. Bad performances, coupled with awful direction and hackneyed, cliched writing puts this on my list of films to avoid. The film obviously tried to capitalize on Muniz's rising star power among youngsters and families, but offered little substance for this film to endure. There is never an indication at what makes this dog so special. And it' hard to believe that only two dogs were used for Skip; his appearance changes quite frequently throughout the film.If you want a recent ""uplifting"" family film, opt for ""The Sandlot."""
"What a terrible accessory!- The strap that latches the case keeps getting on the way when trying to write.- The Palm V can't fit on the hotsynch craddle without removing the case. What a pain!- It adds quite a bit of builkiness to the Palm V, making it harder to carry it on a shirt or jacket pocket.I need to find an alternative somehow...I wish my original standard cover hadn't broken..."
"I type in steve hanks and up comes Wayne Gretzky, however underneath it mentions the book I want but I can't get to it. The author is Steve Hanks. The name of the book is The Art of Steve Hanks"
"First the disclaimers: I only read the first 100 pages and I'm a pretty extreme left winger on social issues.I never imagined this book could be so awful. It is essentially a package to present mindless blathering on political issues and uses every canned cliche of the ""liberal media."" I couldn't finish it. I'm so irritated by this book I'm venting it out here rather than waiting a bit and crafting a more decent review.I really enjoyed the entire Ender series and generally have found OSC's other books at least passably readable. However, I seriously doubt I will ever consider picking up another of his books without first getting some glowing recommendations."
dont buy piece of junk barly shaves anything dont waste your money or beard. have better luck picking hair with twessers. and thats a fact so please dont buy
"This guy has been accused of molesting students. Something he forgot to mention in his history of the town.From the Burlington Free Press:""In the spring, (Superintendent) Wrend placed Bryer on administrative leave but never reported him to the Vermont Education Department for possible license suspension. In a letter, she threatened to seek suspension unless Bryer agreed to discuss leaving the district.He complied and signed an agreement guaranteeing him full pay during his three-month leave, a job reference and a promise from school officials to frame his departure in ""positive"" terms. In exchange, Bryer agreed to resign effective June 30 and not sue the district.He quickly found a teaching job in Colchester.""Read more: [...]This is how Morrisville has been dealing with these problems for decades. That would have made one hell of a chapter in his book."
"Cacaphony and melodic mush. This album was very disappointing. As a lover of fusion, jazz, rock, worldbeat....music in general, this album requires a lot of patience to feel where the musicians were going. It's a clashing discordant ball of disappointed listening. And I WANTED to like it!"
"This Apex seems to be a fine unit, except the sound quality on the DVD side is quite poor. Quality otherwise has been good, unlike some of the previous reviews. Have they improved these, or did I just get a good one?"
"For those of you who rated this one highly, here's one of ....We have a bent lawyer who unknowingly has 2 CIA agents posing in his office. There are a multitude of hidden cameras filming the lawyer day and night and yet when he goes to the prison the CIA only put a mic in his briefcase which ... is supposed to be as big as a golf ball in this day and age. All the time reading it I was thinking, why haven't they wired him all over? A team of crack CIA operatives are watching this pathetic drunk and yet he eludes him - but still ... for some unfathomable reason. while the real 'crooks' somehow don't get knocked off by the CIA and in the bargain get 2 million dollars each. It's bloody rubbish!!! And childish. In fact, the plot would insult a 12 year old.No star. Dreadful!!"
"The movie is one of the all-time best horror films ever made. This DVD is a shining example of why you should do progressive transfers. Awful hazy non-progressive transfer may be animorphic... but it's filled with every bad video artifact you can think of (ghosting, combing, it's awfully blurry too). Do yourself a favor and buy the Collector's Edition from amazon.co.uk. It has a much better transfer, DTS sound and cool extras. Skip this."
"One of my biggest requirements when buying an umbrella is that it be one of substance. The handle should be weighty, the stalk should be solid and able to withstand high winds.Unfortunately, this umbrella turned out not to have either of those qualities. The handle was quite small. Typically, a handle should at least be as long as my hand is wide. This handle was about half that, which provided for very poor grip in high wind situations. The stalk also felt like hollow aluminum, not confidence inspiring at all.I returned this umbrella, I would never buy it again."
"There are many things wrong with this keyboard, in the first that it's a novel concept, and was directed to be a 'keyboard' marketed towards gamers. I fell for the advertising and spent the first few hours messing with the various configurations and being in awe of the keymapping, but in the end you are still left with a very sub-par product - a rubber dome based keyboard, with folding gimmick top half.It would constantly disconnect from the computer, the drivers had to be reinstalled for it to respond again, it didn't exactly 'work' during bootup other, which forced me to fetch an older keyboard and use that to install Windows..Overall a very shoddy product. If you want a solid gaming keyboard for your money that won't die on you every 15 minutes after two days of ownership, strongly consider a Das Keyboard. It's what I'm writing this review on right now, and I've owned it for more than a year, a long time after I've thrown away the worthless Zboard as well."
"Works exactly as stated, you can also you the cord to connect directly to your PC which give it multiple purposes which is great in any product."
"I use this on a Jornada 525, and I must say you really need that if you want to avoid scrapes on you handheld.But it is not so easy to assemble without making fngerprints on the display (I started using gloves for that). Also the instruction are not so clear. There would be some words helpful.And they are a little to expensive for my taste."
"Music for the paxil overdosed and misguided. A little talent in the drum department does not mean this band is progressive. After I heard this I thought I needed paxil. I honestly cannot believe King Crimson opened for this garbage. I guess they thought they could ride the coattails of this popular band. Yes, millions can be wrong including pedroza, daniel aka pebozo."
"After 3 hours of playing this game my brain went into shut down mode, kinda like from staring at a wall for 3 hours. Belive me this game is just pretty, and if you like killing things mind-lessly then, by all means play this game! The Maximum IQ you can have to enjoy this game is 125. If your IQ is higher than 125, then you will not like it in most cases."
I love this game. I play it with my family all the time. Since we watch alot of movies together we have alot of fun playing. Some of the questions are really challenging so it makes us think harder. Now we pay closer attention to the movies we watch so we'll be better the next time we play Movie Mania. It's really a fun game!
Sex PistolsThe recording is rough but ok if your a Sex Pistols fan. The packaging is far greater than the quality of the CD inside. Recommended for the experienced ear of a true Sex Pistols fan.
This product is complete and easy to use.There are times when a computer search just doesn't meet my needs.This product allows me to look up verses by content without fail.
"These have a very different feel from the metal brushes I have used, but they have some practical advantages.One minor downside on this particular set was that the end caps came off in my hands as soon as I started playing. They were very poorly glued on, but remounting with more and better glue solved this problem. I did not experience this with another set I bought."
"Obviously, you all have no life to speak of...I would've given it a lower rating (like a MINUS 3-star!), but I couldn't find it!"
"I first read ""The Lottery"" in high school and it has stayed with me ever since. I bought this book for the title story, and it is the most powerful of the stories, though the others are also very entertaining. Hopefully it will also stay with you.Ms Jackson is a phenomenally talented writer. You know immediately that there is something wrong with the simple village lottery, and the suspense and horror builds with every word. That this can be achieved in the space of a short story is amazing - we have a very lttle time before we are faced with the shocking truth.""The Lottery"" is the finest short story of its genre, and stands alone as one of the greatest stories ever written. Shirley Jackson is a master, and her novels ""The Haunting of Hill House"" and ""We Have Always Lived in the Castle"" are also engrossing reads. But ""The Lottery""? Well, you will never forget the twist in the tale."
"Good Book. Very Interesting. Michael Swango - guilty of all charges including murder. I am appalled by what he got away with in the medical field. I am appalled that the doctors and hospitals allowed him to get away with it, and they should have been the ones to 'blow the whistle' on him. Unbelievable! I didn't think this could ever happen in the United States and in the medical field."
"Pick holder. Will hold about 8-10 picks depending on the type of pick you prefer. Obviously thick picks will mean less storage, thin ones will mean more. Overall it is great for the boyfriend who is constantly losing his picks."
"The only reason I give this box set one star is because I can't watch it EXCEPT on my computer. For 4 1/2 seasons' worth, I've enjoyed these episodes on my Dynex flat screen. But - and I've had this experience with several other CBS DVDs, for some reason there is some glitch in these DVD discs where they cannot play on my TV set. So BEWARE! I will not purchase another CBS set of DVDs unless I test them at the store first, which is, of course, impossible. I LOATHE playing DVDs on my computer, which I use for - dare I mention it - work.LET THE BUYER BEWARE. CBS IS GUILTY."
"these speakers are wonderful! and adorable! my only gripe is that they're fairly lightweight and if the sound is up loud, they tend to rumble right off my shelf. and although i do wish they went a little louder, they're pretty stellar for the size and price."
"I bought this a while ago and im rather pleased with it. It works good as a cd player and it never has skipped on me. The mp3 cds can hold ver 100 songs and are VERY COOL!!!! un fortunatly, some of my mp3 files didn't play through the cd player, and some didnt even show up on the display. It is kind of difficult to make a cd and get it formatted right. Several of the cds i made didnt work at all, and it took several tries to get my first mp3 cd working, but once i did it was very usefull. The text search feature is kind of cool but i never use it. When u can get an mp3 cd to work it is very cool but it is kind of hard. RThe manual sucks. The cd player is kind of bulky so i wouldnt try jogging with it. but most mp3 cd players are pretty big. It gets scratched easily so watch out. but overall it is very good."
"the KKV (king, Keohane and Verba) is one the best tool for beginners in research for social, political, International Relations students or academics. it delivers advices and problems that researchers will come across at one moment of the research life. it also offers a good overview and critical analysis of what research is.the authors make sure the heavy subject that is reasearch in social sciences is not too heavy to read. the books approaches the different methodologies that research will have to chose.if not owned yet, it is in need to be buy and must belong the student private library."
"This is an interesting read, but the basic premise (Ireland taken over by the Church with a capital C, women oppressed, the IRA to the rescue), doesn't ring true, and the rest suffers badly. A more socially aware future history of Ireland would be fabulous--I wish this had a little more flair to it."
"I have started to see changes in the texture of my skin and I really love this product, goes on easily and smoothly. Takes a little time to notice changes but it is good."
"There is absolutely nothing special about Carrie's voice. Carrie won American Idol because she is young, blonde and pretty. Period. Clearly, she was far from the best vocal in this year's competition. Her voice is extremely average. I predict she MIGHT have one more hit and then fade into the same obscurity that Ruben is in, and Fantasia is headed towards."
"We buy that and we are thinking return, You can't see the software using a normal computer you have to buy first a super computer to run that. The Flight simulator 2004 is better running in a normal PC. you can't see all graphics and detail without a super machine.My machine is a Pentium M 1.7 Ghz 512 Ram, Toshiba Tecra and take 4 hour in the installation process, and 1 complete day to play the simulator.Don't do that to us microsoft please.............."
A great book. Highly recommended. If you are looking for a page turner this one will qualify! One of the better science fiction books I've read lately.
"Keith Murray steps out for another dictionary rhyme book tales with another album entitled Enigma. He impressively both used a vocabulary to conversant with scholars and entertained his listeners with tales of adventure with titles like ""World Be Free"" and the heartfelt ""To My Mans"" featuring Dave Hollister. As he begins by antagonizing others on ""Intro"" it continues over to ""Call My Name"" as he dares any competition to contest. ""Dangerous Ground"" featuring 50 Grand is more upbeat than usual for Keith, but his ability to adapt nearly passes by. The highlight of this LP is ""What A Feelin'"" with its groovy, scale runs with the bass. ""Love L.O.D."" featuring 50 Grand & Kel-Vicious is a good display of patience and the tight knit of L.O.D. as the trio shows why they are the nicest in this profession. To close, Keith Murray's Enigma is lyrically fulfilling."
This so called romance novel is nothing but 300 pages of a girl having her period and whining. Read only if you want to lose your lunch. The last chapter they finally have sex but then find out she was child molested. How does this ever get on the romance book list? Disappointment and waste of six bucks
I spoke Azeri relatively well once and decided to pick up this little book to revisit the language. Out of the limited amount of literature on the subject I chose this one on a hunch and it's nothing more than a phrase book for a tourist to get around. It does a good job of indroducing the most common expressions to an English speaker. Expect to find exact pronounciation of singlular words and 2-3 word phrases and expressions. Do not expect a textbook on the language :)
"For those of you unfamiliar with JSS,he has been around for many years with Yngwie,Talisman,and most recently Journey. He is a very talented,yet underrated vocalist. This is an extremely impressive effort that any fan of the Melodic Rock scene would be glad to own. Give it a listen. You will be glad that you did."
"There's not much wrong with this film, but it has changed the way I watch films forever. Previously I had laughed at the misrepresentation of other peoples misery in films, its portrayal as not really being as bad as the sufferer says it is. I'm sure most of us have at some time or another laughed at the misfortunate medical circumstances of others as represented on film. But after seeing this film I now feel ashamed and angry at the effect that films can have on the way society thinks of and treats people.Jack Nicholson, if you're going to play a character suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and phobias HAVE THE DECENCY TO RESEARCH THE CONDITION AND PUT SOME EFFORT INTO CONVEYING THE MISERY IT BRINGS, rather than just playing it half-heartedly for laughs."
"The the Pelonis B-6A1 ceramic heater is an excellent product. The folks that own and operate True Value Superstores on Amazon.com are Top Quality people. I appreciate their effort to achieve customer satisfaction, and products at an exceptional price."
"except maybe Jeanette Winterson's ""Written on the Body."" I felt deeply pulled in by this novel, which unfolds slowly and bathes you in an incredibly intoxicating, emotional mist. It is highly erotic and engrossing, and one of the only well written and overtly bisexual works of fiction. The only failure here is the ending which becomes a little too melodramatic and (I think) untrue to at least one of the characters. But the quality of language, plot, and character are very, very high. I took it in while I was recovering from a break-up and the relationships in Searle's book were enough to distract me. I consider it my rebound (without the consequences). Please read this book."
"This is one of those movies that you watch and then, within a few days, you forget about.Sarah Jessica Parker plays Paula, a ""launcher"" or something. Parents hire Paula to coax their adult children into leaving home and getting a place of their own. Sound stupid enough for you already?Paula is hired by the parents of Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) and the story is about how, during the course of her employment, she falls in love with him, and he with her. There are a very few laughs along the way.Some might call this a ""chick flick"" but my wife (who is a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker and ""Sex and the City"") didn't like it either."
"I just finished watching Six Feet Under on Bravo. All I can say is, thank God for Bravo replaying the series! I never watched it while it was on HBO but now that I have a DVR I made sure to DVR the entire series. I just watched the final episode last night. I cannot tell you how much this series touched me. It really gave me insights into both life and death. I grew to love the characters and could identify with a lot of things about them. They made me look at my own life in a new way.The final three episodes are the best three episodes of any TV show, ever. I seriously spent almost the entire last three episodes crying. They were so wonderful and I LOVED the ending of the very last episode. As stated by previous commenters, it was the best ending of a series EVER! I want to own this DVD set just so I can watch the last three episodes again and again. I highly recommend this DVD and the entire series!"
I have worn Levis for years. This style does not fit in a similar fashion to previous 569's. The material also feels extremely thin and not as durable as their previous lines. I would not recommend these jeans.
I have just received this bag today and I absolutely love it! The color is exactly as it appears on the website! It was the exact color I was looking for and it is beautiful!
"Excellent! This really is a great collection of mixes. When I pop this one in my car, I find it hard to decide which one to start with. Here's me thinking: ""Let's see, I'll start with... the original version, NO WAIT! number three, NO TWO! FOUR, I meant FOUR! NO TWO!!!..."" No wonder I'm always late for work - I spend half my day dancing in the car. A must-have for those who like remixed k.d."
"This book is an excellent choice for engineers trying to design and model air pollution control plants, equipment and processes.It also gives useful details on installation and operational costs."
"The best night time CD for infants, toddlers and young children. All my children listen to this when they fall asleep at night. I start playing this when they are infants and my 9 year old still falls asleep to this CD. It is very soothing."
"Don't waste your money to buy this battery!!!!!!Even it is fully charged, it only able to take less than 10 photos or give you message ""please change the battery"". Save your money to buy canon brand which is working a lot better."
My wife got to watch this movie with me and my mom for the first time. She had never heard of it before! She was impressed with all the singing and dancing in the movie and even had me pause so she could learn some of the dancing in it. lol
"This cd is not good. I think that R Kelly could do way better. I bought this cd on hope that it would be some bomb @#$ R Kelly @&%!. When I got in my car and started listening to this mess I was disapointed. I'm a 25 yr old woman and this cd does not appeal to me at all. R Kelly is too old to be puttin mess like this out.I dont even think Usher would take this route. Best song on the cd is ""Imma flirt"".The song ""Same Girl"" is not tight. Usher should slap hisself for saying yes to the song. Note to R Kelly:Stop making songs with stupid induendos. It was tight at first but its stupid now. make a better cd next time."
"Each chapter in the book shows making of another model, from beginning to end. Each model is of a German vehicle, and that's how the book got its title. All in all it seems just coincidental - the book would be no better or worse if it was not the case.The book is definitely targeted at beginners, and it does an OK job, but nothing more. Some advice seems questionable - for example preshading with a Sharpie; in my experience it'll seep from underneath any kind of paint.Overall the book was disappointing for me. It may be of some use for a beginner, but that's about it."
"This is absolutely cool. I am overclocking Quad6600 from 2.4 to 3.6. And I am using this machine to simulate numerical analysis using parallelized program. With full power of all processors, the lowest fan speed is enough to control the temperature....Cool, Cool, Cool!"
Raymond McLain is a master of playful bluegrass music. His genius play of strings makes this CD a gem. I can't help but smile when listening to it!
"All London office worker Richard Mayhew tried to do that evening was help a damsel in distress, but he got more - way more - than he bargained for. Neil Gaiman has spun another magical mystery tour from the elements of the mythological quest paradigm. Underworlds, eternity, horrific beasts to be slain, labyrinths, immortality, heroes and antiheroes - it's all here in modern form, but nothing crucial really changes, does it? Reading this book is like watching a movie in your head. And through it all, the hapless Richard discovers a well of personal courage that he never thought existed. A timeless tale of humanity's existential search told anew, skillfully written and highly recommended. It's a trip!"
"This book was required reading for my up and coming 6th grader. She hates to read, but this book has been a riot. She is not into Barbie, pink or much girly stuff. Fortunately, neither is Catherine. She and my daughter have a lot in common. I would highly recommend this book for all girls. If the boys can get past the sprinkling of puberty stuff they will like her antics too."
"This is a very poorly designed product, especially considering it is far more expensive than most sets I have bought before. The clips that hold the curlers in place are huge, there is no where convenient to put them like the small metal ones. They are heavy and feel clumsy on my head. There is no where nice to grab the curlers so I burn my fingers sometimes. I guess it heats up fine, but they are so difficult to deal with that I have yet to get a nice curl."
"Cute turtle, but way too loud! There's no volume control and the pieces are hard to get to stay in the spaces on the turtle. Give it 5 minutes and you'll get sick of hearing ""SHAPES, ANIMALS,COLORS!"" Yard sale, here it comes..."
"My son and I love reading this book together. He adores the pictures, the rhyming text, and all the animals portrayed in the book. A great read for all ages!"
"In spite of my only chosing 2 stars for the book, I can see why ""The Light Ages"" was chosen for the World Fantasy Award. Macleod obviously is an experienced and careful writer, and his depictions of the town of Bracebridge and the lives of the people there are so well done that I could almost see the individuals he described.That said, though, I was not able to finish the book because the action is so slow moving. Macleod loves his descriptions of the people and the work of removing aether from the ground, but he spends so much time on those depictions that the narrative just creeps along. I finally gave up, even though I enjoyed reading about the world Macleod was creating, because I felt it was taking too long to get to the action."
"A very scholarly, well researched exposure of the real meaning of the scriptures, eliminating much of the esoteric meanings in the obscure, ambiguous and seemingly contradictory passages and enlightening us as to the meaning of terms in use at that time. By paralleling the recorded history of the times and the written word of the gospels we are ably guided to concur with the author that the apocalypse is a fait accompli. The bible and gospels should be understood not with the modern accepted meaning of the word but that of the meaning in use at the time of the writing. A fascinating, well written, book that is sure to captivate your attention. Highly recommended to searchers of the truth whether you be a bible reader or not.Louis H. Lafontaine, Eng."
"Laura Nyro was a gifted song writer and I loved the sound of her voice. If she was guilty of suicidal screeching, as has been suggested by some, what does that say about every other over paid rock diva? But honestly, this album has always left me a bit chilled. The landscape is bleak. There is a good groove going on Lucky, I never understood 'Dig those potatoes.' I wish I could have been there to talk her out of that line. Timer has wonderful potential, but oh that introduction. The recording of Sweet Blindness, endearing song, is a mess. There are under-appreciated gems here, December's Boudoir and The Confession. Don't dismiss this album out of hand, no artist could make a more penetrating statement about urban life. Some say it took them years to ""Get"" Laura Nyro. She grabbed me on my first hearing as a young teen-ager and never let go. If there is a more gifted singer-song writer out there, I don't know who it is."
It was much smaller that I anticipated. So small can't see guardian angel on pendant. Very disappointed. The pendant had to be magnified to be able to take a picture.
"I purchased this car holder for my z520a phone. The connector on the bottom of this car holder is completely inadequate for a car installation. A slight bump of the wire, or taking a turn too quick will cause the connector to come loose. The Sony Ericsson engineers should have known better."
to any Playstation 2 owner do not buy this adaptor for your PS2 because it will mess up the system and it won't let you play DVD's or DVD-ROM games.it is also recommended by the Sony company that made the PS2 and PSone to not to use this adaptor only use the adaptor that has the Sony Playstation 2 or Sony Playstation logo on the adaptor.
The issues that prompted this film remain. Nothing has changed and that's what's scary. Charlton Heston as himself gives a frightening performance.
"I love this movie! The story line, the actors, the music are all excellent! This movie/play was created during the time when the Vietnam War was slowly coming toward an end.The songs compliment the political atmosphere in that era, and they certainly fit in today with what has been going on in D.C. for the past eight years. Yes, I'm including both Congress and the White House, ""Piddle, twiddle, and resolve, not one thing is ever solved"" fits what has been going on with Democrats and Republicans to a 'T'.Speaking of ""Piddle, twiddle, and resolve"" the only disappointment I have with this DVD is that the diector didn't include the full version of the song. You can find the full version on the CD of ""1776"" but not on this DVD.Other than that, excellent movie!"
hard to believe this is 20 years old. I was grooving to this jam a whole lot back in the day. he hit some serious notes on this New Jack Swing inspired groove and Jam. the remix was cool as well.i bought the tape back in the day and wore this cut out.
"I think that this book has helped me greatly to become a better person, see the glass half full, have a more positive opinion towards myself and others, and make me feel happier everyday. It would definitely help some one who has low self esteem issues. Very well written."
"I bought this product due to the sloping seats in my Dodge Caravan and thought that it was going to be very useful. Boy, was I wrong. When I tried to put this under my infant carseat it brought the carseat so far away from the back of the seat that I was unable to safely buckle it. There was no way to get a tight fit for the carseat using the 1 inch rule. (the carseat should not move more than 1 inch in any direction) I again tried to use the leveler when we converted to a convertible carseat,and yet again no luck. I recommend the poll noddles, they are much easier to use and a fraction of the cost."
"...that self titled albums are a band's best. While this album is by no means poor, there is certainly nothing fundamentally wrong with it, it does not compare to their debut ""Up the Bracket"". However, the album is built on the strained relationship between the creative core of the band, Pete Doherty and Carl Bart. This tense writing style is epitomised by the album's flagship song, ""Can't Stand Me Now"".I think that while this record is definitely worthy of any self respecting collection, if I could only buy one Libertines' album, this would not be it."
I had heard one of their songs on GAC and decided to buy the CD just for the heck of it. It was fantistic. I had never heard a first album that was so polished with songs that I fell in love with.

"This tool for injecting dye into R-134a car A/C systems works exactly as it's designed. It uses disposable dye cartidges that are threaded on both end with caps. When you are attaching the plunger and coupler hose, be aware that large end is sealed inside with the piston, but the small end will spill if it isn't held upright when you attach the coupler hose. I was very happy to see that the plunger assembly is entirely made of metal. It only has rubber covers on it.Not sure where it's made, there's no marking I can see. It's a well made injector, though."
"This mug keeps my coffee or cocoa nice and hot for a long time,and the cap functions wonderfully as far as spill stopping but at the cost of being a complete pain to clean/get the coffee smell out of."
"I used to work in a yarn shop. I have saved so many pamphlets and photo-copied a ton of patterns for sweaters, afghans, etc. that I would never make just to have patterns for the details. This book has helped me declutter! I can't believe that she has all of this in one book. Thank you, thank you, thank you! The patterns from ""Knitting on the Edge"" that I have used have all worked out. I have also easily been able to vary the patterns to work into the piece I was working on. She's made it very simple. And having worked some of the edges in - they really have made the pieces 100% richer looking. (Borrowed it from our library and had to buy my own copy.)"
"I love this CD, to me it's a classic... it brings back memories from high school...some of the melancholy lyrics (like, 'I Know It's Over') can make you feel bad, that it feels good..LOL"
very easy to operate. Downloads well and saving your place is better than others that cost more.
"This coffeemaker works well. It is inexpensive, easy to fill, easy to clean and fairly fast. The only minor drawback is the lack of an externally visible fill level. The internal fill mark is just about impossible to see, so you really have to measure the water you put in. The automatic shut-off is a big plus. I previously had a similar Toastess model (Toastess TFC-326 Personal-Size 1-Cup Coffeemaker, Black) which was also a good coffeemaker. It had an external fill indicator, but it lacked the automatic shut-off. I kept forgetting to turn it off after making coffee, which probably contributed to its early demise."
"I am about 20 minutes into this documentary and find that my interest in watching further is seriously challenged by my inability to understand what the three remaining brothers are talking about. Three middle-aged fellows muttering into their beards or to their feet or to the middle distance do not make riveting storytelling, if one has NO idea what they are saying in their country accents. My enjoyment and understanding would be enhanced 100% if there were subtitles. It's not too late to reach a wider audience...."
Bought this for my boss who uses 2 hearing aids. He absolutely loves it and it does not interfere with his hearing aids. The volume control is excellent and you don't need to use it on the highest setting it is so powerful. You can also adjust it to accomodate the pitch of different voices. Would highly recommend this product for those who cannot hear well.
This book didn't do much for me. Suffer The Children and Protege had me hooked instantly. This book seemed like it took forever to get things going. Some parts were so down-right boring I actually skimmed thru just to see if anything interesting was going to happen.

"The Q&A approach adopted in this book is very useful. It would provide for a very useful reference manual on M&A if its content were not so dated. Its discussion of taxes, accounting, and deal structures does not reflect recent changes in rules and M&A practices. It would be helpful if the author would update the material. Other more current and more comprehensive books on the subject that I have found useful include Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring activities by Depamphilis and Bruner's M&A book."
"So far I have had no complaints with this camera. It gives me all the manual options I like to have. I love the way it recycles so quickly so I am ready to take another picture. Somtimes the camera is out of focus and I can't quite figure out the problem. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. I'm sure it's a setting that I'm not quite of. With all the options, I sometimes forget what setting I have it on."
The card was good while it lasted but I expected a life cycle of greater than 1 year.
Good Mini SD great price also and as always amazon great with getting it to me in a timely manner.
I've tried every one of these flea tick so called stoppers on my Rottie and hands down this stuff works the best and longest out of all of them. Will be buying this stuff from now on.
"I stayed up until 1:00 AM to finish it... it was so good, I couldn't wait to see what happened next! At first I thought it would be your typical ""chick"" type book... but it was not at all!!! At the risk of sounding cliche', I must say this book tells a wonderful and inspiring story of love, personal growth, and following your dreams. The NYC references were so fun to read, having lived in NYC myself. The story itself holds a great, positive message, and an interesting twist at the end. I REALLY HOPE to see this come out in a movie! I highly recommend this book!!!"
"This radio is only good for Sirius. The CD player works on a whim and the controls are so tiny it was like they were designed for a mouse. The remote has never worked, even for selecting stations. No FM/AM reception and I live in a major metropolitan area on the east coast. It is far too big and bulky just for the Sirius part. I kept it tucked in a dark corner its infrequent usage warrants.My only regret about the review is that I cannot give it no stars."
"Unlike her husband, Hillary Rodham Clinton has not demonstrated any talent for writing. Her ""Living History"" is really a sad demonstration of her skill or lack of it as an author. If you want to read some well written words try ""My Life"" by Bill Clinton."
before TTTT my life was an empty pool of mysery. Post tttt It's been roses and sunshine. I can't even describe the joy in my life now. Thank you tttt!
"I was hoping for more given who Simon's father is, but it seems he's gone down the same cheese-filled road that Phil did eventually. I thought that maybe we'd get to experience some of the innovation and originality that Phil had early in his career with early Genesis and his first couple of solo albums, but Simon gives us something that's OK to play in the background yet doesn't hold up to real listening, in my opinion. I'm not intentionally slagging the guy -- it's very apparent that he has talent, but he just doesn't quite have the creative songwriting tools to make it jump out yet."
This book is only 80 pages and offers suggestions about avoiding malpractice using 20 briefly described cases for purposes of illustration.This book is fairly elementary and offers little unique insight.For such a book I found the cost listed on the book($35.00)incredibly high.
"He explains stuff really well, I like Johnny McArthur, he is level headed about the Bible and hasn't been blown back and forth by every wind of doctrine. When you are done reading the book it'd be a good gift for someone, because it's actually really pretty looking LOL"
"This book is exactly what I was hoping for. It has great suggestions for for the modern bride who might be paying for most of the wedding along with her groom to be. Instead of old school rules and focusing on stuff one could care less about, like many of the books I have seen or have purchased.Great book and at a great price. It is not the only book one would need, but it is perfect in addition to another guide or organizer."
"Little Tikes Bathtime BandI purchased this time for my two toddlers for Christmas. It looked so cute and my 15 month old loves music. It was going to be a surefire hit. Unfortunately it has never worked. We tried new batteries, pouring water simultaneuosly in the cups, one at a time, nothing has worked. As it was Xmas morning, the box is long gone. I wish we had read the reviews. Do not buy this toy unless you want some realy disappointed kids."
"The story line of this book is phenomenal. I started thinking it was going to be a quick read because the sample was hard to put down. The authors are very descriptive and there are very little grammatical errors. But, I started to get a little bored about 60% through. The detailing started to seem drawn out and it was difficult for me to finish. The build up to the conclusion was predictable ( in my opinion) which made it even more difficult to finish. I would still recommend the book to anyone who is looking for a detailed and highly researched account of what happened in Juarez during the span of murders."
"If you need your info fluffy and pretty, here's your book, but it was cotton-candy to my hunger for bread and meat. I read the whole thing in the Border's parking lot, went back in and exchanged it for some remaindered cookbooks."
This was just awful. Schlock. Formulaic. Unoriginal. Remaindering is a mercy killing. Not a book to give someone if you want to get them hooked on fantasy fiction.
"Not a bad compilation, even though the opera singer sketch and a coupla other oft-played sketches were somehow omitted. Very old clips were still enjoyed -- there were more of them than in more recent years, which were usually in color (from TV guest shots or from concerts)."
"I bought this camera because it was advertised to be Mac compatible. Unfortunately, it only works with Mac OS 9 and below, which haven't been produced since 2002 or so. Also, the design of the camera is such that you have to place it at eye level (it doesn't pivot up enough) and yet there's no way to attach it to a laptop. So you have to place it on top of a pile of books or something to have it angle correctly.Too bad. I was hoping it would be an inexpensive camera to use in talking with my husband overseas."
"I have to write that this album is the most beautiful from all albums of Pablo. Pablo sings more profeionally. His voice in the song Olvidarte jamás is very preciosa. The best songs are: olvidarte jamás, toda ley, gallo de pelea, se te olvido, vas a entender, como tenerte otra vez... Muchas gracias Pablito"
"My Oppo BD-83 blu ray player has never hit a snag in six months of use (even when I was using it during their beta program, it played all DVD's and Blu-Rays). Then it met ""Summer."" The disc started to play a trailer and halted in the middle. Then it jumped to the main menu. There, despite hitting every ""play"" and/or ""select"" button on the remote to advance, it would do nothing except provide the universal circle with the red line through it on the upper left screen. I tried close to 10 times, reloading and so on. Nothing worked. I double-checked live to the Internet for the latest firmware updates. But my player is up to date. When I tried another disc, the player briefly had a problem until I restarted everything again. My player definitely did not like Summer or whatever Fox has put on this disc that is causing the problem. Beware."
"When I made the mistake of reading this tell-all book,It was clear to me that the writer was very bitter. The book tells us little that shock`s,and seems to have been a means of revenge towards Marlo Thomas. What is also odd, is that not one unkind word is written about Phil Donahue,leading the reader to believe he must not have any say in his own home."
"If you are looking to understand the value of business process simulation from an executive stand-point, this is a great book.Profozich explains through examples and case studies how simulation can help companies make better business decisions and managage necessary changes in their operating environment.All business environments operate within areas of uncertainty. This book explains how simulation technology can help business managers understand and use this uncertainty to their advantage.Business simulation can support business managers across all functions of the enterprise and help create value in a number of ways. Unfortunately businesses are not taking advantage of this great technology. Profozich has managed to demystify the myth around the complexities of computer simulation and he explains the value proposition and approach in a very compelling way."
"I bought this game on day one based on the fact that it was a next-gen shadowrun. I read about it and became very excited about the gameplay and the new ideas. But then I actually played it. With all the time, effort and money put into this game, why is there absolutly no single player story mode. This is based on a world with some of the richest history in pen-and-paper rpgs out there. Why could they not even muster up the time to put in even an average single player mode. (the lame bot matches and training missions don't count) I mean for crying out loud, even halo and gears of war had memorable storys and characters. And those were based on brand new ideas ad licenses. Its not that the gameplay is bad. The multi-player is actually very well thought out. But for a game that costs us 60 dollars, there is absolutly no excuse for no story mode. I'm not even going to start on the lack of maps. (which is pretty pathetic for a basically online only game."
"On their debut album, Cheap Trick's masterful pop hooks were cut with a nasty metallic edge that quickly got sanded down on subsequent releases. Rick Nielsen's guitar crackles with a palpable electricity, and the sparse production refuses to add gloss or tidy up in any way. The vocal melodies are Beatlesque in the best sense, made all the more impressive by Robin Zander's uncanny ability to sing like both Lennon and McCartney. There's an adult malevolence at work here that is completely at odds with the harmless cartoon the band became. Forget the power pop bliss they're known for, because on this album Cheap Trick were aiming to rock."
This is a disgrace to racing and all car games in general... to bad such a powerful system does not have games like Metropolis street racing on the dreamcast. Dont buy this game... it is horrible!
"I have a 20 pack of these, and niether of my recordable drives will accept them. I got one to burn, but all of the rest have been rejected at every attempt. Save yourself the trouble and look for another brand."
"""Strength and Honor: The Life of Dolly Madison"" by Richard (...) Cote is excellent reading and a work of art. Mr. Cote has once again shown that he is one of the best writers of our era. His work continues to excel and there is no limit to his artistic ability to dazzel the reader with his painting of history with a flair that only his author's brush can make. This is another masterpiece that hangs well beside ""Mary's World"" and ""Theodosia Burr Alston"""
"This album is actually really good. Although short, it's definitely showsMonica has matured. Although the first track that was released was not that great, tracks like dozen roses and gotta move on makes us remember why fans will continue to support Monica. Hell No is definitely one of the best tracks on the album but what i didn't like is the fact that she tries the rapping too much. I prefer to hear her voice and think that she should stay true to the talented R&B; Singer that she is."
I wasn't completely satisifed with this DVD. I felt it could have oferred more Scenery of the Oregon Coastline.
This film bored me to death. The pacing is off and the protagonist is very poorly played. Not worth the effort.
"Whomever designed this was definitely a minimalist. The ""slot"" for business cards is barely useable, the zippered compartment for the keyboard is a challenge to zip up- hope you're not in a hurry and there is absolutely NO room for an extra stylus, a memory card/stick. Save some $ and look for something else."
"There is nothing I can say other than this is the perfect recording. Denyce Graves has chosen arias that we don't always get to hear and I thank her for doing so, she breathes live into the old standards from ""Carmen"" and introduces us to arias that will undoubtably become new favorites. Denyce's voice is absolutely fabulous, it's powerful yet calm and perfectly refined, I can say nothing bad about her voice or this recording."
"I agree with Ms Praiseworthy and Mr Eggdrop Soup, there's a straightforwardness to the jazz that makes it a little too much like fourplay, but at the same time, Mr Khan's rendition of Don't you worry 'bout a thing carries into a new height, ergo...I have the limit my review to that one song and give it some praise."
"Got the phone yesterday and it was a nice looking phone. Exactly what i wanted. Heres the but.... The battery was warped. Very noticeably warped. Almost ready to explode. I threw it back in the box as quickly as i could, sealed it back and now i have to return it which will probably be such a hassle. I guess i could just purchase another battery to keep from having to go thru that headache. Motorola is really at fault though."
"The glass jug came along with three other items I ordered from Amazon. And of course since I was so eager to try the jug I opened it first and uh, the thing was broken to 23443 different pieces. The ice container and the lid were the only things I could make out from the box. The packaging sucks! It wasn't even labeled as FRAGILE. Such a disappointment! I've ordered countless products from Amazon and never was I let down like this. Blah. Never again."
I love this coffeemaker and everything about it. Makes great coffee and it's super easy to use. I would reccomend this product to anyone who enjoys good coffee!
"soft and comfy. After a couple wear and washes the started to get a little stringy looking, especially the white one."
"This cable does not fit the Coolpix 800, as advertised. Buy at your own risk."
"I was so excited for this product as I can't sleep if I'm too warm and I love the cold side of a pillow! First of all, I got it and it was nearly impossible to let the air out like they said. Water spilled everywhere. I had 3 people working on it! Sure, it's cool for a little while. But after a few hours of sleep that thing REALLY heats up! I woke up one morning after about 8 sweating profusely because it had gotten so warm. Unbearably hot! It doesn't work...You know what people say about how if it sounds too good to be true it probably is? In this case, it is."
"I brought this book and it's terrible. I took the 2001 AP and I am 100% sure I got a 5, even though I didn't get the results yet. I just know bio cold. I could have written a much better book than this (now there's an idea...) The authors talk about topics that are not important at all and do a 7th grade level review of the important topics. I would go with the Cliff's book or Barron's College Review Series in Biology if you want a review book. The best advise I can give is to read the textbook, and DO NOT waste any money on this book. This book is very poorly written."
"After reading the reviews for this and the last couple books, I am very happy I gave up on the series in 2000. This probably would have been an excellent series if Jordan had kept it to 6 or 7 books. As it is, I think Jordan is just padding his wallet. The ego of the man is outrageous, to blame his readers, his CUSTOMERS, for getting bored with / not being able to follow his plot lines.Read George Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. He is handling multiple plot lines the RIGHT way."
"The Tipping Point is one the greatest books I have read (right up there with Stephen Covey). I loved the Tipping Point so much,I've been recommending it to family and friends since I started the Introduction. The Tipping Point will not only leave your notepad full of new ideas, but will change the way you think about work and your life.5-stars across the board!!"
"The Lost World is a lackluster, forced sequel to Jurassic Park, a childhood favorite of mine. The fact that I could identify it as such at the age of twelve, when the book was first published, should not bode well for the prospective reader."
Brian`s parents are divorced.He is going to visit his dad who lives in New york. When a tragic accident happens.He is forced to live in the Canadian wilderness with only a hatchet and a survival kit. Hatchet is one of the best books I`ve ever read . I would recommened it to anyone who likes adventures.
"Many books on motorcycles abound with glossy pictures but contain little facts. This slim volume by Roland Brown is quite the reverse. The majority of photos are original B&Ws, not staged fashion shots, and there is ample text. It is not a coffee table book, it is a real book! The history begins with Soichiro Honda's start after WWII and traces the company's progress to 1989. For the real motorcyclist there is plenty of technical detail which is used to show the evolution from one machine to the next, rather than being just tabulated facts. The story of the development of motorcycles, as we now know them, and the fascinating saga of a multinational company's growth, make excellent reading. My only complaint is that a book this slim (150 small pages), really doesn't warrant a price tag of $25. Never the less, I still bought it, and was glad I did."
"Quaint and inaccurate Reviewer: Eva Webster-Frizzell from Tennessee I have read and am appalled at the first of many inaccuracies in this book. The first, most glaring to anyone from the area is the caption of the two-page ""homecoming"" picture. The actual gathering is for a baptism. Anyone not recognizing this has spent a year not learning. Very disappointed in this book. I bought the book for my sister, a PHN working with people in very poor circumstances in the Sequatchie Valley of Tennessee. She had hoped to see the documentary but missed it. I hope she can look over the problems with the book, we can forgive Yankees who try to look at and into our lives and consistently get the wrong information. By the way, our widowed mother reared twin daughters without ever resorting to welfare."
"The seller themselves were prompt with shipment and great with packaging, but this product was not worth the care the took. We couldn't use the product at all. The holes were not properly drilled to allow any screw keep the product in place in the computer. The plastic is beyond cheap. We have gone back and ordered a proper aluminum bracket and hope to have better luck. Please beware when purchasing this item!"
"I bought this DVD to supplement Brooke Siler's ""The Pilates Body"" because I wanted to understand some of the beginning exercises better by seeing them in action. I was very disappointed in I received. The exercises amount to simple calisthenics and include very few elements of a standard Pilates mat program. I'm no fitness guru but doing the entire program hardly raised my pulse or challenged my muscles.The DVD format itself is quite nice. If you are looking for some very low-intensity stretches and warmup exercises, this is a great DVD to get. However, calling this a Pilates DVD is a misrepresentation of its content."
"I wasn't happy with this book, but to be fair to this fabulous author, I went back and read it again. Unfortunately, it was just as boring the second time around. I don't know what happened to this one. The characters didn't shine, and there was no spark in the story."
"Great concept, fair execution. I expected much more from these discs. Most of the tunes on disc 1 are a bit too sparse for my tastes...I was expecting more ""electro"" or ""electroclash"" styles. The Juan Maclean track is more of an agressive style that I like...too bad the rest isn't in this same vein.I mainly bought this for disc 2. Many classics I have on vinyl and I wanted to see how this guy handled the mix...doesn't really come through. The Bigod 20 track is actually ""Body to Body"" and not ""The Bog"". The second Front 242 track is pitched up significantly...I would have worked it into the mix elsewhere. These cds were mixed on Native Instrument's Tracktor software, with which I'm unfamiliar...maybe that has something to do with the odd style of mixing.Overall this is a nice addition to anyone's DJ mixed CD collection...good, not great."
"Nice case for the Zune. Fairly bulky, however hard to avoid considering the size of the player. Good protection for another electronic device especially in the hands of my teenage daughter."
"As the other reviews say, this book is fantastic! There are great ideas for holidays, but also neat suggestions for birthdays, school days (getting homework done), special rituals to start the day, for bedtime, mealtime, etc... Throughout the book there also are helpful websites and tons of insightful, creative ideas. It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't sell it directly!"
"I am shocked there are not more books about the personal life of this interesting person in history. This book gives a very good picture of Philip II and the forces that shaped him and the religion that governed every aspect of his life, loves and holy causes. Because of his long reign, and dealings with all the important persons of the 16th century, his personal attitudes shaped so much by his childhood, influenced the political, social and religious tide of that time. The conquests of lands in the name of God, influences the geography and history of today"
"I really like the concept of this machine. I use it sporadically, mostly to store grain, flour, etc. However, while it worked fine initially it progressively has had more and more trouble pulling enough of a vacuum to seal (the sealing part of the machine is only activated when the vacuum reaches a certain point). Now it is totally useless. The rubber seals look to be in good condition and I don't recall any trauma that occurred, such as liquid being sucked into the machine, etc. I don't think that I even used the machine to seal more than 50 bags before it stopped working. What a disappointment!"
"This was trouble free for 2 years, now the Sound is cutting out of the Center Channel like so many have reported. Double checked all the wiring - subbed in a different center channel, it cuts out intermittantly still.Many have noted that they had to crank the volume or turn it off/on to fix. I have found that if you simply turn off the ""MCACC Auto Sound"" and switch it back on, the sound will come back.But then the Sound will cut out again later. Happens daily at this point.This will be my last Pioneer I purchase.Now I'm looking at the Onkyo TX-SR607 - it seems to get a lot of good press at an affordable price.PIONEER HAD A DESIGN FLAW with this product!!"
"We know that the media is left-wing ; everybody knows that, right? Not Eric Alterman and he'll tell you why the media is far more conservative than you think. While I think he overstates his case, this is an excellent, well-researched book.I don't think he'll change too many minds,as people who are convinced the media is liberal are not going to change their minds just by reading a book, even such a persuasive one as What Liberal Media.I would ask any readers of this book to read this with an open mind and perhaps you might come around to Alterman's point of view."
"I bought this as a gift for my sister. However, I myself have always enjoyed the short story genre for many years."
"Possessed is the first book to examine the phenomenon of demon possession in Russia. Drawing upon a wide range of sources--religious, psychiatric, ethnographic, and literary--Worobec looks at klikushestvo over a broad span of time but focuses mainly on the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when all of Russian society felt the pressure of modernization."
"The third of the Local H cd's, this one was the best of the bunch. It would have been a larger selling cd if it was promoted by the company the way it should have been.This is the last Local H cd where Joe Daniels is on the drums. Joe left shortly after & a new guy came in who doesn't have Joe's talent."
This album is outstanding. Zucchero is a true find in exciting popular music. I can't keep his albums for myself...everyone wants them.
very well made product and nice looking. I gave it to a friend for a birthday gift - he liked it.
"Well, the sound is supose to be Dolby Digital 5.0 but is only kind of stereo: the rear speakers are not used almost at all.The IMAGE...what a HORROR...sometimes is like a bad TV broadcast with lines and bad pixels all over!! Sometimes is just OK.The content is amazing, one of the best concert I saw of Alvin Lee:) a must have for any fan!!I realy don't know how they could produce such a bad DVD, shame that this is the only Alvin Lee DVD available(beside the Woodstock DVD)!!"
I gave this one star just because you can not give zero stars.the writing is stunted and changes tense on the fly. Sometimes you can not tell the author has changed who is speaking or thinking. I had too many times where I had to re-read several sentences to figure out who was saying what about whom. 85 pages in and it still had nothing to keep me reading. I gave up. Money in the toilet!
Better than a smelly pan sitting on the counter. With the liners it is easy to take to the backyard composter.
"I was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. Most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book. This was the first book on statistics and law that I bought and read, so I don't know how to compare it to others. But I will select and try another to see if what I am looking for is out there."
"I would give this book 5 starts, becausae it is written by such a well-known and eminient Islamic scholar. However, the price is such a deterrant, no-one but financial institutions will read it. This is a complaint against many Islamic authors - they rip you off with the extortionate prices of their books. What happend to the Quranic injunction to spread knowledge??"
"I liked the book, although I was looking for a much more in depth treatment of the subject. The author consistently stresses that if you choose to be a con artist you will be caught and exhibits some frustration that con artists are not punished more severly than they are, since most con artist crimes are perceived as crimes the victims brought on themselves through their own greed and avarice.The title is somewhat misleading. Don't read this is you want to actually be a con artist as you won't learn too many tricks. There is a detailed explanation on how to short change someone, which I found interesting, but most other con artist tricks are given vague explanations.If you want to know about con artists read this as part of a more extensive study as it does not stand on its own as a resource."
"Sheila Peele-Miller wonderfully captures a young woman's growing pains. This is a true example of ""what looks good, is not always good for us."" I felt myself feeling bad for Alicia. She loved so hard, but Derek was damaged goods. Hopefully he learned something at the cost of losing most likely the best woman he ever had. I enjoyed reading ""Painted Picture.""B. RichardsonGAAL Book Club of Atlanta"
"THIS CD CHANGER IS GREAT I'VE HAD ONE IN MY CAR FOR 15 YEARS. BUT THE ONE I GOT THROUGH YOU GUYS WAS DEFECTIVE AND WHOLESALE AV DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER ONE , SO I HAD TO BUY IT SOMEWHERE ELSE MY ACCOUNT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CREDITED ACCORDINGLY. THANK YOU KEITH STEINKE"
"After about 10 charge cycles in the Olypus charger, it does not even hold a charge anymore. The capacity was never as much as the original Olympus battery and it continually got worse. It did not cost much but still was not worth the price. I definitely do not recommend this battery."
"This book contains two memorable stories. The first deals with being a Member of the Body of Christ even when you don't care for the other person sharing your pew. And there is a memorable answer to the question,"" What can one do if one finds it impossible to affirm certain tenets of the Creed?"""
"My two terrier mixes (20 and 30 lbs., respectively) absolutely adore their new Ruffians Octopus. The smaller dog has a little trouble gripping this size, but the larger especially loves tossing and squeaking her new favorite possession (sometimes to noisy excess). Best of all, neither dog's aggressive chewing appears to have made a dent in more than two weeks.Highly recommended. Great fetch item."
This is not a 5 star film. And I have to agree with Acute Observer in finding this not realistic or believable in many aspects. As flawed as our government is I highly doubt that the FBI would allow a club that hunts young black men to continue on while they look for more evidence. And I found it impossible to believe that Debra Winger's character could continue to love Berenger after discovering that he was a racist murderer. This film is a guilty pleasure- albeit a wierd one. It plays more like a tv movie than a brilliant feature film. It is extremely dated and is written for a junior high or high school level of intellect.
This dvd would not play. Thought was going to be new but was just a burnt dvd in a case with a printed picture
Very entertaining. Spent a lot of nights plagued with insomnia watching Glee. Wish season 4 was available. Great music and show numbers.
"I'd never read Sandra Brown, and, based on ""The Switch,"" won't look to read more.A potentially interesting plot was ruined by ludicrous dialogue, unbelievable characters, and extremely unlikely plot twists (even allowing for the initial premise). And anyone who was surprised by the ending ought to be ashamed.No, wait. That's not true. Readers who thought early on that they had spotted the ending were encouraged to think otherwise by the fact that in several places Brown refers specifically to Melina out of the context of a conversation. E.g. on page 344 a new chapter section begins: Melina repeated to Chief the half of the conversation that he hadn't overheard. Well, it wasn't Melina, we find at the end, so Brown effectively set up a climax, as it were, that made no sense.Too bad. Identical twins can make for interesting reading, but they don't make the grade here."
"I have only written reviews for books I have genuinely liked. This is the first time I have written a ""Don't buy this book"" warning. Buy it used or get it from the library if you must read it. But it is a plotless waste of time and I am more sorry about that than I can say."
"I saw this product in a pet store and decided to go online to read the online reviews of the product before I actually bought it. All the reviews were surprisingly positive so I figured I'd try it - why not? At least, I could listen to it and relax even if the animals didn't. Well! My two dogs (a shep mix and an akita mix) and the two cats were actually listening and then they went to sleep! It really did calm them down!"
This product is cheap. It looks cheap and I am sure it is not very durable. I should have spent a little more to get better quality but thought I was getting a good deal. The only use I may get out of these is to save them for a camping trip or inclement weather. Maybe they can protect the new mats I will be ordering.
"I found the first Babe movie adorable, whereas Babe: Pig in the City somewhat lacking. The dog/street scene was enough for me to want to stop watching the movie. Expecting to be entertained by a ""feel good"" movie, I was grossly disappointed. I would not recommend this movie for any age."
"from puerto rican school girl to wannabe hoochie mama wishing she was ghetto to kissing madonna at the vma's what will christina do next i wonder but put out more crappy cd's with lil kim, timbaland or whoever just to get street credibility."
"I was very eager to buy this CD. I have the CD Elixir and I love it. I saw and heard fourplay in Atlanta and they were awesome. However, this CD has too much computerized music. Too many sythensized voices. Very predictable. In my estimation, a bunch of tracks to play on smooth jazz radio stations or in an elevator as mindless filler. I didn't care for this one at all."
"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift. It lasted less than one day before it began to leak air. The net and stand part lasted longer before it began to lose air---almost three days! It is really too bad because if the quality were better, this would be a wonderful, fun item."
"It's an enormous improvement from the second edition, which I also own a copy of. The book covers everything you need to know to pass state and national board examinations and become a licensed dispensing optician. My only complaints are that its contents are ordered somewhat counterintuitively, and that it's a very large, heavy volume (I have enough to tote around with my tools!)"
"Rev. Moon, the guy the republicans don't want you to know about is the man ""With The Plan"" according to Poppy Bush- maybe his divine guidance helped shape Dumbya's economic miracle. Afterall, Moon says he's the REAL messiah! What else could explain the oceans of lies spun out by the winger think tanks and reported as gospel truth if divine intervention isn't involved?

"A good way to describe this book might be to say that it is what /Reminiscence of a Stock Operator/ would have been like had Philip Roth written it.Many times while I was reading this, I had to look at the back cover and reread Ace Greenberg's quote: ""Buzzy Schwartz is a winner....All else is nonsense."" Because this book is so full of insipid nonsense, you might forget Schwartz is, in fact, a winner.I suggest checking it out at the library and reading only the last two chapters, which actually have something in them that could be called ""lessons"". (Please note the title of this book.) Forget the rest, it's nonsense. Like many other reviewers here have said, there is no system on a silver platter. Take what you can find and do your own research.Whatever you decide, realize that no great trader would ever ""need"" this book, certainly not for its ""psychological insights"". Buzzy wouldn't have, at least."
"Theres nothing worse than computer graphics, not to mention trying to make a make a sequal or re- make call it what you will. sometimes things are better left alone! an absolute insult to the 80s classic American Werewolf in London. Those of you who grew up when I did know what Im talking about. AS far as Im concerned there were very few classic horror movies made from the 90s up to present time.. now everything is done with computers,Even our horror movies are now subject to this lazy key punching generation LONG LIVE RAY HARRYHAUSSEN!!!!!!!"
"Hampton Sides' telling of the rescue of 500 POWS, survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March, by U.S. Army Rangers in the Philippines during the waning days of World War II is an outstanding job of reportage. Sides tells the story from the eyes of the rescued and their rescuers, building suspense that wasn't always present in the The Great Raid, the film adaptation of his story. As a working journalist for more than 30 years, I know I good story when I read one, and this one falls into that category."
"Skynyrd had a great point. As an undergrad, I have never seen such unethical use of graphing in my life. I would not recommend this book. There was plenty of info, but ethics are ethics. This book violated those ethics and shame on the publisher for printing that."
"All the reviews here are dead on. This is NOT something I'd recommend at all. Yes, it work on a very basic level without syncing to Quickbooks. But it crashes all the time and it has tons of quirks. Buy something else."
"Recently I cancelled my cable connection after seeing that I could save $35 a month by just buying this book and using it instead. What I got was really disappointing, it doesn't even have Facebook inside it. My kids are now restless at night because they can't see their friends' pictures and updates. My wife isn't too happy either, this book hardly mentions anything about celebrities. This is really misleading and I am contacting the publisher. If you are looking for the whole Internet ON PAPER then look elsewhere, don't buy this!"
"I recently purchased this dvd. I was thinking about going to either Mallorca or the Canary Islands next year. This dvd was informative but it is very outdated. It says 2000, but the film was done back in the 1980's. The sound quality is not very good and it looks like they transferred the film from a vhs tape. I kept the dvd just because there is some good information, and it does cover the different Canary Islands."
"I have never read such derivative, kitchy, self-serving, cash-cow milking drivel in my entire life. This author needs to start his quest for immortality by seeking to grow up.A representative quote:""My childhood friends have all grown old, fat, and ugly.I now look more like their son than their classmate or peer. I am still getting carded by bouncers at bars and clubs. I will outlive my enemies - and marry their children."""
I want this on DVD when it is released on DVD in anamorphic widescreen I will give it a better review.
Did not receive hard copy. I would like to receive this book if paid for it. I receive an electronic version.
"I ordered this as a replacement for my Airport Extreme power cable. It is not an Apple product and is the wrong size for the Aiport Extreme. Therefore, it was of no use to me. It is very frustrating to have the product listed as being for an Airport Extreme when it is no such thing. Will not buy again from this seller."
"Good product and good customer service, however the mounting screws are wrapped in a small plastic pouch and stuffed inside of the small hollow space. This space has unfinished sharp edges inside and I recieved a 1 inch cut across my finger when I remove this hardware.Valley Forge 2 Postion White Powder Coated Aluminum Bracket"
"The Kindle device is truly amazing. I bought four of them; one for myself and three as Christmas gifts.I have two suggestions for future redesigns:1. Relocate the On-Off and the Antenna switches from the back of the device to the top leading edge. This makes it unnecessary to remove the device from its cover.2. To the right and left of the ""amazonkindle"" logo, add raised areas for thumbs to ""dig in"", making it easier to hold the device (especially when in bed, about to drift off into ""la-la land""!)."
"Fantastic Shredder. I've had others that granted, were cheaper, and they were total JUNK. This one is flawless. You don't have to position the paper just so in the slot, like with my last junky shredder. It's a little bigger, size-wise, than others, but worth it for how it easily chews up a whole envelope full of junk mail."
"This show is colorful and easy to follow for small children. The lessons are simple and an example of good values which is rare these days on television with all of the mindless, worthless cartoons out there. My son loves it and laughs with the characters, I feel good because he is also getting a good lesson! I have recommended this to all of my friends with young children."
"My kids LOVE these spoons. One did break when an enthusiastic ice-cream fan used it to try and scoop out some hard ice cream from the freezer, but they are great (and very cute!) to eat your ice cream with."
"Domingo, bless him, just doesn't make Wagner for me. Too light, I think. AndNorman's matronly voice doesn't fit Kundry imo. if you like these singers, it's a gorgeous recording."
"I am currently on the medifast diet and have had trouble with constipation. This has helped tremendously. I even have my Husband on the tea to help with the liver claims. Taste is not bad, not good just bland. Try a small box and then you'll buy the larger size like I did!"
"IT LAST me like 1month of use, it sucks.. really really sucks.. i mean she felt apart she broked down in a hundred pieces.. IT SUCKS DONT BUY IT.. NOT RECOMENDED AT ALL"
"Enigma: The Best of Jeff Hardy is a real Good DVD. I own the Jeff Hardy and the AJ Styles DVD. AJ's DVD is a lot better, the Enigma: The Best of Jeff Hardy was a lot more better then I expect it would be. Hardy only been in TNA for one year and I know TNA is trying to make money so they rush this DVD out. But the matches are good, dam the cage match is awesome and his match with AJ Styles is great even if I think they can have an even better one. The DVD is good and I would love to own a lot more TNA Wrestling DVD's, but there all selling out in a lot of stores so my advice to you is to get it when you can. Amazon.com I'm sure has a good stock on them. Enigma could have been better in a longer run but it's still a fun Wrestling DVD."
"I have read all the bad reviews for this game. It is boring when you use the controller but if you have the dance pad it's a blast. I have five kids 9-1yrs. and they all love to watch someone do this game on the dance pad as well as do it. This is a dance pad game. The dance pad plugs in like a controller and has all the same buttons as the controller. This is fun to jump around trying to keep up. Try the dance pad if you still have the game, it's worth it. They have other dance games as well like jungle book. Hope this helps"
"I'm sorry, but everytime i hear Creed, I have to shudder. No, I'm not a harcore punk, and I don't listen to oldies all day. But Creed is the most unoriginal band I have ever heard. Find some music with actual emotion."

"very poor quality heart, huge doesn't even look close to other models. very disappointed spend a few more dollars and get a better quality heart. not good for learning."
"These things were horrible from this vendor. I know its impossible to know on a blind shot. but dude, these bags were like vacuum sealed together. I had to peel open each envelope. Huge paid in the neck. You should be able to just open it and insert whatever you put in.It was so annoying, I would literally get the blow gun on my air compressor and blow air into about 20 or so at a time just to prep them for use."
"I used these product for two years, and I bought them from other websites. It is the first time I bought this product on Amazon but it tuned out to be a fake.The product I had been used smelt nothing, but this one smells very differently and it smells like a molten metal. I am so angry and it's in my trash can now.I need an explanation !!!!!!!!!!!I seriously have been using this product for two years!!"
"I was looking for this kind of socks to wear on my wedding day! And they are perfect, exactly what i was looking for!. Good quality, comfortable, good price and delivered on time!"
"The adapter did not have a spring loaded tip like pretty much all other car adapters do, which is probably why it took some fiddling to get the adapter to make contact with the socket and provide power. If it was moved slightly, power would cut out and it would need to be adjusted again. Also, the fuse recently burnt out on mine and can't really be replaced. It's cheap and works technically, but unless you only need one for one weekend, spend your money on something built a little better."
"I am a strict vegetarian who does not use any animal products, so you can imagine my shock when I opened my shipment and found that there were REAL COWHIDE slippers inside!!!! The description clearly says 'FAUX' and the box that came was NOT faux. The description is incorrect in the listing, or someone slipped the wrong pair into the shipment by accident - TWICE!!! Either way - horrible mistake!!!! I bought a pair for my father and one for my boyfriend, who is also a strict vegetarian. Both boxes contained real cowhide slippers. (Why does Amazon NOT let you choose zero stars?)"
"This was my first experiance with an electric pump, and was awful! The motor was very weak and it did not provide the proper suction. I called the company and told them of my complaints, they sent me a new motor and new washer rings (the rings in case the suction was being broken) however neither helped. This pump was loud, and painful and did not allow me to pump enough milk. The suction release is manualy operated but the motor could not keep up with the number up times I would need to relase per minute to simulate my baby's sucking, witch made let down even harder! I do not suggest to anyone to buy this product."
"The Edge 305 has all of the bells and whistles that you would want in a bicycle computer. Each of the functions is relatively easy to use, providing great infomation concerning speed, cadence, heart rate, elevation, ascent, grade, etc. The only draw back is that the battery does not last more than a few hours. This is a negative if you are out on a tour. Two weeks ago I did GRABRAAWR in Wisconsin. This seven day ride covering 430 miles was great, but every night I needed to find an outlet so that I could recharge the battery. This is the only fault that I can find in the Edge 305."
"Sturve bacteria to death. And where, in bowels (!?) What an increadible idea ! By using this diet you practically illiminate any iron containing food from your menu. So if you have digestive deasese and most likely, already having difficulties absorbing Vitamin B complex and iron - you are on the way to killing yourself. After being on SCD for 7 months and becoming progressively weak and pale, I've had a routine blood test done, which came up with Hematocrite of 23 (!) At that point my physycian was insisting on blood transfusion, but I was lucky to get out of the situation with just Iron pills."
HI I never got the baby pool and I didnt know who to call to let you know I didnt get it I would like If I can get that pool some time soon seen as I paid for it if you have any questions to ask me call me at 508 540 4272 I would really like that alot thank you so muchChristina Jones
"The description of ""universal fit"" is misleading. It was much too big for my Hyundai Accent. Plus hard to install. Better off to buy entire shaft assembly."
"As non-biased reader (no Scottish roots or ties), I found this a good book. Its coverage of the Scottish Enlightenment is excellent - and this is the best part of the book. He covers both the individuals and their theories very well and its highly readable. However, after he moves on from the Enlightenment, it becomes quite tenuous. Claiming the Scots were responsible for the British Empire, America and Canada is a little bit of a stretch? Also, this book can be a bit of a heavy read at times."
"So if you're a bit like me, you look forward to New Year's Eve and July 4th...not just for all the fun and festivities (and fireworks on July 4th) but also for the Twilight Zone marathon on SciFy. Every year I always catch and episode or two that I've never seen before, and catch a few I know by heart, enjoying every second of it.So during the winter months this year I decided to splurge and buy the entire series box set, every episode in original air date order. This is the Ultimate Twilight Zone package for any fan. Plus bonuses too many to list, complete with a booklet which gives a quick synopsis of every episode. Simply put, you can't do better than this. All struck from the original camera negative and magnetic soundtrack it says right here on the box, and it definitely looks that way on my TV screen.So do yourself a favor, if you're an old fan or new, grab this set and beat those cold winter night blues, you will love it!T"
I love these Dick and Jane books! My son got so much better at reading going through these. I don't know why they ever stopped making books like this.
This is a poignant documentary of life among the remaining Jews in the Carpathians. It has outstanding traditional Jewish and Gypsy music and is interesting for showing the connections between the two communities.
"I'm sorry to ruin this movie's perfect reputation here on amazon.com, but this movie doesn't deserve any more than I gave it. Sorry."
I love our country and I was not disappointed when I opened my Sierra Club wall calender. The pictures are wonderful. I could not have chosen any better locations myself. The quality of the prints are superb enough to frame.
"Stargirl (Susan Caraway real name) after being most of her life in homeschooling going to a public school was weird for her. Once she got to Mica Area High she had every pair of eyes on her, used to wear long, pioneer-style dresses, played a ukulele in the halls and in lunch room, and carried her pet rat Cinnamon with her.She made people happy with most of her things after a while. Leo Borlock follows the unspoken rule at Mica Area High :don't stand out rule. But when Stargirl gets to him everything changes and Leo falls in love with her.This book is absolutely amazing this was one of my favorite books its a book that once you open you can't close."
"A perfect balance of Lao Tzu and Confucious.However there is a more elegant and poetic English translation under a different title is translated by Thomas Cleary:""Back To Beginnings"" (on Shamabala Publictions) though Cleary did selectively leave out some of the numbered meditations (and their numerical references).Note:Hong Yingming's Taoist mane is Huanchu Daoren.Get both books and understand the extent of the translator's art.If you read Chinese don't get Back to Beginnings get this version because it has English and Chinese side by side.One can learn from any version, this book is special."
"Salty, too hard to bite, and tastes like chewing on a salt lick. With so much sodium, this is totally a terrible choice. Do not buy!"

"Having only been familiar with Demons & Wizards (the side-project of Iced Earth's Jon Schaffer and Blind Guardian's Hansi Kursch - a project which I absolutely love) I figured it was high time to check out Schaffer's prime band. I could not have been more disappointed. If The Blessed and the Damned is Iced Earth's ""Best Of"", I will definately not be wasting my time checking out their other cds. This may sound harsh, but I had high expectations after listening to Demons & Wizards. Schaffer, hook back up with Hansi and make a third D&W cd. Please!"
A few friends recommended this book and I had read many good reviews so I was looking forward to it. I did not like it and had to push myself to finish. A VERY slow start and the pace never picked up.
"Bought for our grandson he loves them, plays with them every time he comes over to vist papa and granma"
"The freedom to move anywhere on the huge, fanstastically detailed mountains make the game worth buying. The tricks, soundtrack and snow effects are gravy. I really wish it supported simultaneous multiplayer ( especially across xbox's ) but its still good."
"hey, i just got the cd... the boys still got it! this new one is so great. it such a great new sound. it's like a new style of music meets the guys from the 90s. i love it! they've really matured! oh, and i reccomend that ya'll get the duel disk if you can. it's only like a dollar more and it's got some great stuff on the dvd. hey, for all ya'll goin to a concert, scream loud for me and all us here in NC, cause they're not comin back down here. :( oh well, i love em anyway! 5 years hasn't changed my opinion at all."
"After these lessons, I can recognize the phrases ""Do you understand..."", ""Do you speak..."", and ""Do you know..."" instantly. And I can answer them without thinking about my response. But that's all I've really learned, and one of the most intimidating features of Russian is the alphabet.The pronunciation is easy to follow, and the repetitiveness will ensure that these phrases are etched into your memory forever. However, on the whole, it's not a great introduction or overview of the language itself."
"Takes a bit of doing to get results, not sure why, maybe the blades. Had one before that worked great until it was dropped."
"From the box, this looks like a good horror movie, but it's not. It's slow, and there are no really scary scenes. It's creepy, but nothing at all like the Blair Witch Project.If you're looking for a good newer horror movie, don't waste your money on this movie. Get House of Wax or Hostel instead."
"What a powerful group when they came on the scene!! ""More than a Feeling"" boosted them into worldwide following. ""Peace of Mind"" and ""Don't Look Back"" are great tunes on this album!"
"Considering all the information and documentaries out on the subject of Frank Lucas and his Harlem Heydays, this one is extremely disappointing. Amateur and uninformative, this one was a stinker."
"Word of mouth and all the 5-star reviews of this book had me very excited to read this series but... it just wasn't that funny. Nowhere close to Pratchett or Adams, who I find hysterical. The ending was quite depressing. I kept waiting for it to improve (or get funny) on the next page, and it did when I finally finished..."
I haven't received my products anymore! Gonna get the responsable people and sue them!!!! I wrote to Amazon but haven't hear anything from them!!!
"Good story, terrible writing.Anderson's prose is trite, unimaginative, and, far too often, simply laughable. Which is a shame because the story is compelling.This is a key part of the Star Wars extended universe, however. So, read it if you must. But you've been warned."
The Gleim CPA audio cd's are the best deal for the price you pay. I just passed the FAR section of the CPA exam and all I did was listen to the cd's on my way to work in the morning. I didn't use any other study materials. I highly recommend this product.
"I thought this movie was wonderful. It was suspenseful and kept you in your seat. The acting was better than the last movie, as some of the lines were kind of cheesy. The only thing is, they left out 3 major events! Chloe and Buck's wedding, Amanda and Rayford's wedding, (actually, they never even introduced her!), and most importantly, someones death. But I won't mention whose, for the sake of those who haven't seen the movie, or read the book. I did like this movie. I really did. I just have to wonder why they left these parts out."
"Wow. What a dissapointment! I am surprised to see so many positive comments on the album, but glad to see that a few know what I am talking about. I have both of Fiona Apple's prior albums and found that this one cannot compare. Maybe she should have stuck with Jon Brion? Maybe there was a reason her record label didn't want to release it?I bought this album based on the title track which I loved when I heard it on the radio, as I felt that this track showed some growth, musically and personally. But the rest of the album seems to lack in melody, direction and substance. Even her lyrics don't seem as profound as before, but that could possibly be because I grew up too.I would NOT recommend this album."
"""Death's Deal"" is a fine entry in the solo Raider Western novel series. This series of books focused on the character of Raider, working alone for the Pinkertons after Doc Weatherbee leaves the agency.Most of the plot is taken up with a grueling cattle drive, which brings out the courage and cowardice, good and evil of everybody involved. The major villain is more of a contemporary sociopath than the standard Western bad guy.The solo Raider books just don't have the quality of the earlier Hardin series, but this one is excellent.Highly recommended."
This book was a cute short read with some really yummy recipes (the brisket and the chicken were DELICIOUS!) and humerous and insightful stories to accompany them. Definately worth a read!
"Clever spoof? Scary Movie was a clever spoof. This piece of garbage is poorly scripted, poorly acted, etc....etc..... After seeing it I wanted to open my skull and scoop out any memory of it. Do yourself a favor, if you are thinking about buying this mess please DON'T reproduce. The world has enough stupid people. And by the way Amazon, how about adding a negative stars option to the rating system. It felt dirty having to give this crap even one star."
"I bought this album mistakenly when I was wondering about a song that was featured in the movie ""High Fidelity"" and someboy told me it was ""Peppyrock"" by this band BTK, turns out it was not the song and I hoped that maybe the cd would be good anyway but turned out to be complete and utter garbage. Do not buy this CD they are a rip off of The Chemical brothers. Nothing drives me crazier than when soneone tries to mix both rap and rock."
I absolutely love this sweeper. I keep it charged all the time and use whenever there is anything to pick up. It actually picks up pet hair better than my vacuum cleaners.
"As a person of partly Greek ancestry, and Protestant upbringing, when I contemplated conversion to Roman Catholicism, I asked the priest why I should not become Orthoodox. He smiled and said that would be going in the right direction but why not come all the way home. He gave me this book. Indeed I became a Roman Catholic.I count as kin and the best of friends and brothers in Christ many Orthodox. I am thankful and do believe that I understand them and their religion better than ever for reading this book. Though it condemns certain errors, Soloviev speaks with a true voice of love for the Orthodox.This personal note is all I can add to the excellent reviews that have gone before mine. I do recommend this book especially to Orthodox Christians who are so very important to the future of all Christendom."
As an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell I think this book was garbage. What were you thinking? I purchased this book for vacation reading and should have thrown it away when the trout and crabs started their conversation. Hoping it would improve I continued reading. What a disappointment! I'm sorry I wasted my time and money.
My sisters and I grew up with this cookbook. It is the most-borrowed book I own. i would pay major bucks to have it in hardback. you will never need another cookbook.
"I was very excited to watch this movie. Sadly, I wish that I could get the hour and a half of my time back. A total let down"
The original Twilight movie except without all the teenage drama. If you're a fan of vampire movies this is a must for collection.
A wonderful book for the costume jewelry enthusiast. Great pictures and fantastic writing. It gave me a great insight on the quality and craftsmanship of unsigned pieces of costume jewelry. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in collecting costume jewelry
"This book covers great spans of time and geography and illuminates little discussed, but important and interesting, stretches of history. I found it an easy read, despite the complexity and many characters.The only downside is that more detailed maps, and perhaps a timeline, would have been useful."
I could not even finish this book. It was written with such arrogance and puffing!I found the author to be quite contrive about the true nature of the Holocust and more intent on his personal injustice.He was lucky that he was young and had friends in Germany. His father being a king of some sort is put high onhis list of achievements although the treatment of the women involved with himself and his father would not be so prized.I am going to put this one down and go on to something more worth my minds time. ~
"My father grew up in the north end of Boston, and it brought back lots of fond memories of mygrandmother and the great meals we had at her home with lots of family and friendsgathered around. The recipes are great, although I would have loved more photos!"
"I bought this book in October - it is now February and I have yet to make anything out of this cookbook. I love vegetarian cookbooks and was looking for something quick and easy, but nothing in this book sounded that appetizing or that filling to me (I am not a picky eater by the way). I'm sure there are other vegetarian cookbooks out there that are way better. Skip this one."
"For me, this was a suspense novel, not a whodunit.This is how I saw it: While Mike is trying desperately to get a hold of her life and find a reason to keep on going, a flawless beauty commits suicide out of sheer boredom with her perfect life. Then memories of the girl start to creep back into Mike's consciousness; she was contemptuous of Mike and all things imperfect. Faced with this, Mike makes a decision about her own fate, leaving this reader furious with the dead girl. So who murdered whom?"
"the reason i bought the scanner was so that i could read the codes on my 95 olds but when it i got it, found out that it does not work on the 95 models. over all i love have it. it works fine on all the other vehicles that i have. would love to know if there is another hook-up that i can use with it to be able to read the codes on the 95 olds. it is a great investment for the do it your self person"
"Great Firelighter.I picked up this book at the same time as I picked up The Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer, thinking that both were non-fiction accounts. Boy was I wrong.What I don't understand is what possessed the author into thinking he had a novel in him? Someone deluded him horribly. The book is at times unreadable for any number of reasons. It is unbelievable nonsense, terribly written and edited, and historically inaccurate to the point of being laugh out loud stupid. Which is what I must have been for purchasing it without spotting that bulge of one star reviews.The book is very well reviewed by the authors friends and family and some people who owe him money and that is all."
"I was a huge fan of Bush and now am a fan of Institute. It does sound similar to Bush, but probably because Gavin Rossdale writes all the lyrics and sings all the lead vocals. It has a harder edge than Bush did, but overall I'm glad its similar.I was sad to see Bush break up and am now glad to have another oppotunity to enjoy Gavin's incredible voice and interesting lyric style.If you liked Bush, you should enjoy this album."
"Although critically slashed upon its release it's actually a broad, very entertaining comedy with many funny sequences and performances. Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis are strangely miscast but are by no means bad. De Palma's direction is as stylish as ever and the cinematography is quite beautiful. Worth seeing for the eye-popping camerawork in opening five minutes alone. Had this been an original adaption the critical concensus would have been far better.The DVD offers a nice anamorphic widescreen transfer and no other extras but for the low price it's great."
"This is one of the worst surf movies ever! I mean all of the footage comes from other surf movies that are much much better, and it does not go into enough depth about the strapped crew. It says that laird hamilton and dave kalama are the onlt two apart of the crew, but there are about 10 more surfers in the actual crew. I have to say that also the guy who made this film did not do it very well. I mean you would expect Bruce Browns's son to make a better surf movie than this. (Bruce Brown made one of the best surf films of all time ""The Endless Summer"" series. Sorry but the person who made this film should know more about surfing before they make a film on it."
"I have been a long time user of many tools from both companies and appreciate both of them equally. I mainly purchased this tool because I had not had a Leatherman in a long time.Another reason for going with this tool is I needed something I could carry in my pocket clipped. My Victorinox Swisstool Spirit doesn't have a clip on it and I'm not one to carry a pouch on my belt just to carry my tool. I have to dress professional at work and having a tool clipped inside my pocket is a little more subtle in my opinion.It has a different feel than my Swiss but I can already see how amazing it will be. The Swiss is beautiful, well layed out, smooth, and shiny where the Leatherman Charge TTi just looks mean. The blades on the Leatherman are wicked and the best they offer. Tools are a bit more out of the way but I love the one hand operation blades that I don't get on anything Victorinox that I have."
"These people are not to be dealt with.They are liars:The write up says, ""Set includes a 38"" square table and four comfortable, high-back chairs"". When you order this, it will not arrive with chairs, and the company will offer no apology.They supply damaged materials:We ordered 2 tables. One was quite smashed.They have terrible customer service:So far it is 2 months after I have sent back the table, and still I have not received my credit."
"Fun read, endearing (although unrealistic) characters, interesting plot twists. A great winter beach read!"
"This book is like a Bible for dissidents. I've felt mentally and morally sick working in higher education for close to ten years now and just thought I was crazy. Gatto confirms that it is the system itself which is sick and that the people who run it and benefit are not honest and honorable people and one could fairly label them pathological, I'll even label them as pedophiles for raping the minds, spirits and souls of students. It's rare to see a man speak so truthfully and forcefully and passionately about what is missing today; honor, principle, character, creativity, imagination, independence, and dissent. I'm amazed this man hasn't been assassinated for exposing this dirty game. This book goes way beyond the narrow scope of education, he taps into a world view and value system which is heartening for me, he helps me understand why and how the world is so screwed up. This man should run for president in my opinion"
I have a 30 lb terrier mix rescue. I got this 1 year ago and still in one piece. It is hard plastic so if you have ceramic or hardwood floors it is loud. It does take time for the dog to learn how to get food out. It took my dog an hour or so. I would highly recommend. But always supervise dogs with toys especially when it is new.
"This is a detailed description of the folly of Mr. Barnes, thinking he could micromanage his multi-billion art collection from beyond the grave. The collection now is in good hands. 'The art of the steal' it is not."
"Sorry to be rough on you Sean, but, after reading ""Deliver Us From Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism,"" I have to ask - who told you that you could write? That person is not your friend. As with your radio show, the book is filled with empty anecdotes, circular logic and outright lies. And, despite its obvious shortcomings, I stuck it out and read it from cover to cover, hoping for a payout so at least the four hours of my life weren't wasted. That payout never came. Well, at least I can get 75% of the cost back when I sell it used on Amazon.com. So I'm out, what, 4 hours and 4 bucks? Oh well, it could be worse - I could've read your other book, too..."

You only need to read the jacket copy to know that this book is nothing but a tired rehash of failed creationist arguments. Reading the book doesn't do anything to change this perception. Read Richard Dawkins instead.
These sweatpants were thinner than I expected and they also did not fit well around my waist. They have the one looped cord in the elastic and I find that those don't work as well as one cord split that you can tie.
"I have purchased Gripe Water, And other products for our baby and her Colic issues and i never saw any improvements with that so i figure i would give this a shot. No noticeable difference at all with these Colic tabs. Normally i love Hylands products, but these did not work for us at all."
"Look carefully at the details on this book before you buy. It's tiny. I mean, really tiny. Think ""Little Golden Books"" tiny. Don't waste your money on this - even as a new father gift. It's worth $3 at most. The text itself is mildly amusing, brief, and mostly accurate."
You'd better have tripod ready when purchased this telescope. It's powerful zoom factor 420 mm(equal 35 mm camera). In order to get a good picture from this telescope you must learn how to control exposure and speed shot. It's an excellent tool for Nikon Coolpix 5700.
"The only reason I don't give this book four stars is that it takes about 100 pages to get into, quite a bit for a 400-odd page book, until you consider that it is really a ~6500 page epic divided into 20 chapters. This epic is life, neatly set out in black type, and anyone with a life today will appriciate how similar it is to life 200 years ago. A note of caution, though: if you get through those first hundred pages, you may not be able to put these works down until you've read all twenty volumes."
"As a great fan of Patricia Cornwell, I anxiously await each of her new books, and so it is with a heavy heart that I write this review. This is a horribly written book filled with a cast of unbelievable, bumbling idiots. There is not one intelligent character in this book - nor is there any redeeming feature about this book.What a disappointment. As a reader, I feel angry and insulted that Ms. Cornwell thought this book would be enjoyable to anyone. What a tremendous waste of time: hers as an author, yours as a reader.Message to Ms. Cornwell: Give your readers some credit for having some intelligence.Question for Ms. Cornwell: Why in the world would you write a book like this and then actually allow it to be published?Message to Patricia Cornwell fans: DON'T buy this book - it's a waste of your money and a waste of your time.I gave this book one star only because that is the lowest number allowed. If given the choice, I would rate it a zero."
"This just not any story to do with chickens, it is the story where it disribes the true life of chicken (if the could think and talk). The carecters are so funny the way they talk walk look. i would really recomend this for anybody. If you are depresed for any reson o your are happy watch this movie it is one of the best short movies this year. The only thing wrong about it is that it isn't wallace and gromit but any way it is still a good movie."
A great value. Set-up outside on a back porch to provide a cool breeze in the summertime and it works great.
"I am a sucker for good romantic stories - however, A Walk to Remember is a disappointing third book by Sparks. The characters are shallow and the story is so predictable (if you have read the first two Sparks' novels). The lines are repeated time and time again to bring out the readers' emotions and none of the sentiments touched me deeply ... I'm sorry to say that the book was written to popularize tissue papers. Sparks tried to please the readers too much that he lost the charm that he had so deeply in ""The Notebook"". Please Nicholas, bring back your charm from ""The Notebook"" and stop trying to please the readers ... The Notebook is the best of his novels so far."
"This book was a major disappointment. The author seems todrone on and on about ordinary happenings without providing any pointor revelance to the overall story line. I plodded through the last 100 or so pages hoping for an ending that would tie everything together or at least be a happy one for Trudi. Instead, the book just sort of petered out. I was very disappointed and felt like reading this book was a huge waste of my time. I guess I just didn't get it."
The binding on the book was broken - pages could easily be pulled from the hard cover. A child's name was written on the back inside cover. I would not characterize this book as being in good shape. Very disappointing.
"As the previous reviews pointed out, most of these are not the original recordings and definitely not worth the money. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
"Good for details, much of which I'll never use. Many shortcuts I'll probably never remember, and programs I'll never use. However easy to understand and get a feel for the various programs. Nice useful product, more informative than I needed or expected."
"Wait just a chicken flickin' minute! What is Amazon trying to say about me that this shows up in my Gold Box with the claim that it's been selected ""just for me?"" It doesn't take a detective to figure out what they're seeming to imply, here.Sure, there's probably a good doctoral thesis for someone in many of my issues, but I don't need a big doorstop of a book to self-diagnose actual disorders. Well, more of them, anyway."
"This recording of the fabulous grand concertos by Corelli is one of the best recordings that I own. These concertos should not be taken for granted; they set a precedent for the Concerti grossi by Handel, Geminiani, and many others.I Musici employs their impeccable technique, tone, articulation, and dynamics in this recordings. Philips held up their part of the deal; the sound quality on the recording is unbelievable. No other recording that I own is as crisp and clean as this recording is. A must buy for fans of baroque music."
"I bought these crayons for my daughter based off of the very good reviews they received from other people. I honestly can't even begin to understand WHY people say such good things about crayons. They are NOT durable...maybe they are more durable then the thinnest Crayola crayon but certainly not the jumbo crayons. The color is so light and barely there, it's not fun for young children. The crayons feel weird and are not at all like the color of the actual crayon when the color is on paper. These are the worst crayons I think we've ever used and that includes cheap crayons you get at a restaurant for kids to color with. I usually love Melissa and Doug but I am HIGHLY disappointed with these crayons."
"When I purchased this book I couldn't wait to get it in the mail. I was SO excited about learning about how to ""eat"" for womb health but what I came across was a lot of reference to some healthy womb god idol? I don't know, I was very put off by the constant references to this idol god, and womb circle chants that she suggest we do? I thought I would be able to take from it what I could use, and discard everything else but the references were too frequent, and it put a really bad taste in my mouth, I felt I was being exposed to things that were very oddly relgious, (non-christian) and I am not interested in that. I purchased the book in hopes that I'd learn to eat a certain way for an overall healthy womb, but got a lot of other weird stuff, that made me uneasy, I couldn't finish the book."
"I am a big Tudor fan & love the artwork in this lovely book! I've also tried two of the recipes, so far, & thought they were terrific!"
I would recommend this game to anyone... but I have to say that there's a couple of disappointments i've run into in comparison to previous FIFA Soccer Versions.. in FIFA 2003 I learned that there isn't a Create-A-Player mode in the game which I find disappointing another is gameplay might be too hard for beginners although I'm trying not to be negative this is an awesome game certaintly one of EA Sports best. just those two things disappoint me for some reason but I won't be returning it I'll defenitly enjoy this awesome title !
"If it were made of silicone, it wouldn't get melted and ruined on the tips. I like how it works, though. :)"
"I was debating if I should buy this compilation for the fear of being let down, but I did. I definitely don't regret it. Usually I skip to songs that I enjoy, but driving long distances I noticed that I didn't skip any songs. Very satisfied with my purchased. Some of my favorite tracks include tracks 1.Don't Look Back - Dual Sessions and 7.Insane[Beach Love Mix]"
"Benton Gup gives a very thorough overview of the role of a bank board member and the importance of understanding the major elements that make up a modern financial institution.It is important to note that this is a starter book; if you are currently a bank board member, or contemplating becoming one, you should understand that this book will spur you to further study on major subjects in other books and formats."
"Dont buy it! I used it for 2 weeks and it worked just fine -- was able to get 4 oz within 7 minutes, then all of the sudden, it stopped working. It would still pull at my nipple but nothing would come out -- I would constantly have to readjust the sheild to get more. I called customer service and they said that it was a lactation issue but with another pump I have no problems. DONT GET IT! Buy a hands-free one so that you can walk around the house - you dont want to be tied down to the machine."
The Zurich Time Single Automatic Watch Winder keeps my watch wound but its motor is very noisy. I cannot keep it in my bedroom or it keeps me awake. This is not a quiet winder!
"I have had a set of these Novi 4-channel wireless intercoms for over 12 years. Mine are set up on different wiring circuits in my current home, and they work just fine. I'm not sure why other people are having trouble with them not working on different wiring circuits. One caution: I used to live in a condo, and, apparently, one of the neighbors received a set as a Christmas present, because we began to hear their conversations the day after Christmas. We just switched channels, no more problems."
What started out as a page turner ended up just being boring. Dont be fooled there is no way this book should be rated 4 stars
"Not only is this a simple, timeless, unisex looking mobile, but it is also great for the development of a baby's vision. Whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. Keep in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for months. The panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. The primary colors of Blue Jean Teddy then become noticed. The green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. My baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. The only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. I would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as I and my baby wanted. But the reasonable price of this mobile AS WELL as the cute look of it made it a great buy. Educational baby products don't have to look weird!"
"The RoadMate gets the job done. It isn't the sleekest or smallest GPS but it will get you from A to B, at a very affordable price. The only issue I have faced with the RoadMate so far, is the cost of map updates (around $50.00), but I haven't needed it yet."
This is a great album i was recently introduced to. After doing a bit of searching i found that Baxter has put out several albums since this one in 1998. Anyone know where one might buy these other albums? Id appreciate any help. Thanks
"This novel was absolutely amazing. It follows in the lines of Dan Brown's novel, but has a different twist so it makes the two novels different. Shoeles is an amazing storyteller with a flair for twists that will keep the reader guessing until the very end of the novel! I highly recommend this novel for anyone who loved the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons!"
"Even though I enjoyed this book, I found that it lacked continuity with Robert O'Brien's original book, ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH."" The book was an easier read, but it doesn't have the detail that the first book had. I read both aloud to my students. My students all said they liked the original book better."
"Perhaps I have become desensitized, but I found the novel to be misleading; Cook spends a great deal of time foreshadowing a tragic, haunting event that ends up seeming anticlimactic; I expected something far more sinister. The preview outshines the work itself. I did enjoy reading it, however; Cook's style is soft, understated, and utterly mesmerizing, perfect for late night reading. His style flows and drifts into the subconscious; it's alluring prose, even if it leads to a less than riveting conclusion."
"Mr. Brzezinski feels that America must be replaced as a global village. How I and 250 million other people disagree must be beyond his puny immagination. A one-world governemnt is easier to conquer and force socialism by making the Global Community ""hell on earth"" where only a few thousands engineers run a billion slaves. Zbiginiew, The Trilateral Commission founder and member and long time anti-american elitest and CFR member I have one question. How did a clown like you ever land a job as Professor of John Hopkins University?"
This feeder is made of heavy duty materials that last- I was happy to find one to add to one I had for 8+ years.I like that you can take the bowls out and wash them. For me sometimes my cats want to eat alone and I can just take them apart for seperate feeding.
"Its like the fan boys who talked in superlatives about Planet Terror, and the fan base of sci-fi lemmings on amazon who salivate at edgy, whino-college gutter films like, the ever hyped, and truly disappointing Cloverfield.Kill Bill is just a Jackie Chan film going artsy. It's just art-house on Meth; its ludicrous, which is probably what it is supposed to be from jump street, but I have had enough of Scream acerebral thinking. I am sure it is boat loads of fun working with Quentin. There obviously is a reason movies like this are made. Five stars indeed. I'd rather watch reruns of Ghandi and a marathon on AMC of awful Clint Eastwood films like Unforgiven, then to ever, EVER sit through a Quentin film again.If this is the kind of raw new talent coming from Hollywood in that era, I certainly have a chance to bring my ideas to fruition."
"The music all by itself is all right, but it's ruined by Serrano's lyrics, which are at best, self-absorbed and adolescent, and at worst, just plain sick. Perhaps there are people who don't mind songs about everything from suicide thoughts to pedophilic desires, but as for me, COUNT ME OUT! I removed the CD from the player after the pedophilia song and returned it to Amazon in disgust without even listening to the rest of the CD. I was so grossed out, I don't even care whether or not I get my money back, I just wanted that thing out of my house! Yuck!"
"A stunning yet disturbing portait of a true musical genius. Paul and John had eachother, Brian had only himself, with little group participation other than critisism. This powerful documentary proves, through all his struggles, his music will last forever."
"I don't think MTV came within fifty miles of this band. A couple of the reviews below make me wonder if somebody's working out a personal grudge...Anyway, Toreador is a solid, uptempo, melodic indie rock album by one of the many creative Northwest bands to find themselves trapped at the tail end of the ""grunge"" era. Songs like ""Comet"" and ""Shiva"" are fun, frenetic numbers with a sardonic undertone. One of the best albums of all time? No, of course not. But a good reminder that the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s spawned a lot of quality bands that shouldn't be folded into some one-dimensional ""grunge scene."" Buy it, put it on when you want to feel energized and sing along a little."
"A clever, original, and satisfying manipulation of science-fictiontopoi, Mark Wakely's An Audience for Einstein is a realachievement."
"I absolutely love this book. Originally, I found it and checked it out my campus library. I found it so inspirational and helpful for my design work that I had to buy a copy of my own. It is great for people who are really interested in typography."
"Mac OS X is great. No disputing that. Jaguar was a real step forward. I was glad to pay $130 for that. Panther... well, Apple claims 150 great new features... but there's really only a handful that are useful... and it's a little much for them to ask for $130 again just 1 year later.Great product, but not worth the cost."
"Don't waste your money. David Allen Grier was so funny when he performed on In Living Color, but I now know it's because he was great at supporting roles. When left alone, this comedian leaves alot to desire. The DVD is not good and his stand up routine is just awful. We saw him last night for New Years Eve in Atlantic City. Hard to believe he is the same guy. He had a ""warm up"" comedian come on before him who was hilarious. Don't spend any money on stand up or DVD's for him. You will be dissapointed. No chance here to give no stars. If I could have, I would have."
"This is an amazingly fun and energetic plane. Recommend launching via the direct-toss (as a paper plane) with motors humming.Teaches kids about relative speeds--takeoff and land into the wind, etc.Expect some crashes on first day out, but for the right age it'll be great by the end of the first flight day. I'm enjoying watching this as much as my boy is thrilled flying it!"
"An appalling book.Boring, poorly written, poorly edited.Try Algorithm design manual by Steven S. Skiena or Thomas H. Cormen's Introduction to Algorithms or Kleinberg and Tardos'Algorithm Design or the excellent Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms by Anany V. Levitin instead of this mish-mash."
"too short and from the misleading picture , i thought it would be just the thing but it is much tooo short"
"I used this book for an online class, books and test are bundled together and each time I took the test I had to challenge at lest one question, because it was simply wrong or inaccurate. Test quiz/test questions are non constructive for the most part. Many examples use non-standard fonts that hard to find, making assignments unnecessarily difficult to complete, in some exercises after following all instructions the correct result would not match the examples given again creating difficulty not needed. This books suited for online classes because it often gives instructions which are completely irrelevant in such environment. The books gives a good amount of tips and tricks about MS Office, books needs revising and grouping of lessons."
"I will keep this short and sweet. I have a Sony SRF-M85V. It is horrid. No FM reception, bleeds other stations through. Do not waste one thin dime on this product."
"The feeder has less capacity than it seemed and is not completely squirrel proof. It is sturdy, attractive, and better than most at keeping pests at bay. The birds seem to like it better than the feeder it replaced. I plan to buy one more for the front yard."
"Finally, an instrumental cd that allows dj's to mix withouthaving to buy the single to every popular hip hop song just toget the instrumental. Hopefully more will come."
"This is the worst hyped movie I have ever seen. There is none of the Star Wars magic in this film. None of the characters in the film are sympathetic and Jar Jar is the worst creation in the history of film. Buying this movie is like telling George Lucas that it is okay to make a billion dollar movie with an awful script. The worst thing about this movie is that the computer special effects are the real star and there is no humanity or soul in the film. Star Wars was a great movie because it had characters people could relate to, but this movie has none. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS WORTHLESS MOVIE."
I was so excited that I finally found this movie and when I put it in my DVD player it said that it couldn't play so I tried my Xbox..still didn't work. After trying several other units I was unable to get it to play as it is the UK version of the film and does not work in the states. I am very disappointed with this purchase. It was a waste of my money and time waiting for it to get here. I can't even watch it.
"I have been using these for about an year now, and they are the best ones under $40 that I've owned. Here are some plus points:1. very sturdy metal band resulting in a snug fit2. compact enough to be carried around, without loss in the bass! :)Just be careful not to open the headphones holding the plastic parts - they may break. The best way is to hold the metal band and pull them apart. A very good buy, and highly recommended.-Amarendra"
"Usually I use Merkur blades, but I saw these available and figured, ""I'm sure they'll be fine."" The blades felt dull; they were flimsy, and a couple of the blades in the pack had grime on them when I opened them. My skin was irritated like never before and I got more small cuts than I had from my safety razor since...well, ever, really. Immediately, I hopped on Amazon and ordered a pack of the Merkur blades."
I bought this for a 9yr old boy thinking it would be fun due to all the positive reviews. It was the most boring magic set I've ever seen. The tricks are silly. I think he played with it out of obligation but has never touched it again. Melissa and Doug usually make great toys but I think maybe they should stick to entertaining the smaller children.
"Similar to all the other reviewers, the voice transmission *never* worked on this toy. For some reason, the morse code would be transmitted/received, but the whole point of the toy is the 'talkie' part and this toy does not 'workie', so do not bother getting."
"While Catalina can be at times a stressful environment, King's experience here can only be attributed to her own insecurities. Catalina is an incredibly strong academic school and the faculty here do everything in their power to help students do well. King obviously didn't have the natural ability or drive to succeed that is needed to flourish here, as shown by the fact that the writing in this book would not have recieved a passing grade in my freshman english class."

"I was very excited when i bought this book since i am from the Caribbean.However i was disappointed with it. The authors way of telling the story is very dry and sometimes hard to follow.On several parts of the book i found myself trying to read fast so i can get to the real interesting parts. I believe that the author relies too much on the economics of the region while avoiding telling us important events and information on the region.For example he never tells us why the islands were named with the names that they have today.Why Cuba? Where doest it come from? Why Antigua? Why Martinique? Sometimes this book reads like an economics report which makes it very dull and boring at times.I guess the author assumes you know most of the story.Again, very dull and dry history on a region that is full of history and action."
"I bought one of these from a local store thinking I could take care of some light body hair that I had.This thing didn't do anything but mess my hair up. Here is what I mean...I thought..cool! I will test this bad boy out. I tried to trim some hair on my wrist to test it out. It just pushed my hair around. I took off the rounded foil cutter and did a straight cut from the blade. Even trying that method took too much effort to cut hair.I also thought since it was advertised as a wet/dry that maybe it did better wet. Again..same results. Needless to say, I returned it within a day of buying it."
"these cd from Supermax is not the original recording!When you listening to Supermax great hit LOVE MACHINEyou can hear it by yourself,that he's different from theoriginal recording."
"This book is a fun read for fans of W.C. Fields. But accuracy was not a major issue for the author. Many of the stories have since been disproven by better biographers who bothered to do some research. The author here just accepted all of Fields's gag stories and the output of Paramount's publicity department.This book can be enjoyed, but it should be regarded as a work of fiction that loosely touches on some aspects of the reality of Fields's life.If you want an actual biographer of Fields, you'd do much better with Simon Louvish."
I played this game years ago on the Sega Saturn with my cousin's two kids. They were both as in love with the characters and game play as I was. It wasn't the most challenging of games but the humor and cut scenes made it well worth it.We ended up getting into both the anime and manga because of how much we enjoyed the story. Its a shame you can't get this game for less money but if you can find it for less definitely get it. It was a great ending for a beloved console. Wish I still had this game and my Sega Saturn.
"At the highest setting, the warmest my skin gets is 105F. That's not warm enough to do any good. The controller gets almost as hot at 100F. I have an old heating heating pad that reaches 110F on the middle setting, which is warm enough to do some good."
I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR EACH NEW BOOK BY AMANDA QUICK TO BE PUBLISHED. AM AN AVID FAN. ALTHO THIS ONE IS NOT AS GOOD AS SOME OF HER OTHERS. ie.MISCHIEF--AFFAIR STILL ALL IN ALL HER LADIES ALL LEND A BREATH OF FRESH AIR TO THE REGENCY PERIOD. HER LOVE SCENES ARE BELIEVABLE AND HER MEN ARE RATHER NICE EVEN WHEN PROVEN THAT THEY ARE NOT THE ANSWER TO EVERY MAIDENS PRAYERS. I LIKE IT WHEN THE BAD AND REALLY BAD GUYS GET THEIR JUST REWARDS. ALSO THE STREET CHILDREN ARE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND KINDNESS. ALL IN ALL A GOOD BOOK.
"A few helpful nuggets, strewn randomly across almost 500 pages of rambling natterings. Comically poorly written book. Seems like the author did some excellent research on a worthy topic, but then felt the key findings were too light to monetize, and decided to stretch a very finite set of insights and suggestions that could easily fit on a couple of pages across (multiple!) tedious filibuster books. It pleased me to see the cheap newspaper stock of this incoherent tome disintegrate in my fireplace."
I bought this for my Father and he loved it. I was very happy the package came on time for Father's Day. I would buy from this seller again.
"This is my favorite Cure album. Some people have called this album depressing and morbid, but I love it - it's cathartic! It takes me to another world. How many artists can do that? Everything about this work is gorgeous. I can't live without it!"
"Fortunately, fifteen years (or more) ago, I read this book on my own before my English teacher required it... this is not a book that needs to be analysed and charted. It is one that needs to be absorbed, and felt. It does NOT deserve to be one of those books students hate merely because it's required reading.The characters are as real as books get, the small town one that you might live in now, or your grandparents might have lived in decades ago. The issues - from racism, sibling relationships, and just plain growing up - touch your soul. And it's just plain fun to read.It's a bit of American culture that should be cherished... passed on as the valuable art it is - but to tear it apart with attempts to read into symbolism, or to over analyze it... that nearly denies Harper Lee the respect she deserves for writing it."
This book was bought as part of a Bible Study group and we are finding it very helpful in keeping us focused on providing Christ centered homes for our families.
"This fryer worked great while it lasted. After a year the interlocking electric cord would no longer connect properly, so it wouldn't turn on. After replacing the cord, the unit worked for another year and then quit working completely. Fryer handle has a tendency to keep falling in the fryer, thereby melting the plactic into a twisted horrible fashion.Steer clear of this dud."
"I got this nerf gun for my son who is 4.5. He is not big enough to cock this gun to shoot it. I got one for him and for dad, we played with them when the kids went to bed. Very fun, I want to get bigger ones just for me and daddy, but I need to get a smaller one that our son can work himself."
"I bought this and ""Waiting for Baby"" for my son when I was expecting his first sibling. I was unhappily surprised to find they did not have words, just pictures. That definitely should be part of the product description.It isn't too hard to make up a story, but if I would have known it was lacking words I never would have bought it."
"It works fast. Mineral deposits on the bottom, but not a big problem to clean. It is actually boiling water, not just heating it and also turning off at correct time. I have it for around 2 years. Works fine."
"The Taschen Posterbooks are of excellent quality. The six Van Gogh's given us here, for a very low price, are a nicely representative group. Primarily the most impressive factor is the accuracy with which the colors are reproduced. Having seen many in person, I am very critical of prints with poor to pathetic truth in color. We like them to the point of hanging all 6 in our home. The images are of the cafe at Arles-night, lane with cypresses, one of the sunflowers, one self-portrait, the bridge at Langlois and of course, the bedroom at Arles.Regardless the amount of money you have to spend, definitely buy this little jewel as an adjunct. Or if you are tightly budgeted, what a buy!"
"Not who I thought they were - their style is beyound my taste, so I will drop it off at the kitchen counter at work for someone esle to 'enjoy'"
Guess this product is for a much younger woman. I read some reviews and they were positive but they did not mention there age. That is why 2 stars.
"Bad Movie, bad acting ... ! Even at $0.99 to rent this I felt is was a wasted dollar ... could this movie franchise be anyworse? The entire story is in anti-abortion story written by a Mormon ... the Worst!"
"Once I opened the box, I found that the color seemed to be weird. After, I taste the essence, I found that it was completely different compared with my old one. Therefore I think it was an old perfume. Lastly, I had to travel the next day, so I keep my perfume."
It's okay - it does give you plenty of writing space but if you want convenience then Save your money - invest in a laptop.
"It is confusing for the first few chapters, and I occasionally had to stop and think about the time schemes... but it is incredibly worth it in the end. This is a wonderful love story with, for once, an original concept. It's very well written... I'm surprised this is the author's first book - many of the passages are just so beautifully constructed. Sure, there might be a few plot holes, but they are not important. If the reader does not understand some things, it is because the characters don't either; any confusion simply further conveys the essense of Henry's feeling that he has little control over his life, and Clare's fear that she will lose him."
"Excelente reloj, tiene numeros claros y faciles de ver. Es muy facil de configurar. Es un muy buen reloj por este precio."
"It is a great book, but the updated version is definitely better. It really helped me understand how to stop twisting the lives of the people around me."
"When i researched (apparently not well enough), and got this 2-4 cup Farberware perc, i couldn't have been happier...after using a mr coffee, this coffee was HOT, and delicious and didn't take long....a couple months ago, it blew the GFI plug, and i thought it was someone else's a/c or something...well, it did it three days in a row this week....it no longer works, cuts off before it's done, blows the circuit and therefore, brown water...i'm so disappointed...and now, 20-20 hindsight, i'm reading the one star and two star reviews and see that this is a common element (no pun intended)..amazon, stop selling this piece of crap, please...i love to order everything from you, and always look to amazon first, but this is such a widespread issue with farberware, you should give them the boot..thanks"
I read it over the summer after my boyfriend finished it. To be honest there were some things in the story that surprised me. I thought that the story would have been a little different. I thought some things were also unbelievable but nothing off the charts outrageous. It was long but I was glad because it gave me something to look forward to everyday for a long time. I was entertained by this book.
"I am an avid loose tea user, but I feel like an idiot after the tea ball came apart into 4 pieces (the 2 mesh halves plus the chain and the clasp for the side). For the life of me, I cannot get it to seal the way it is supposed to. I am ready to invest in a much higher quality infuser basket that is just 2 pieces at the most and a no-brainer to use. I am the mother of four; I like things simple and reliable :)"
"This is essential jazz. Everything Max Roach and Clifford Brown did together was a solid 5-star affair. You would be crazy to think otherwise. It doesn't get much better than this folks.Clifford Brown - trumpetMax Roach - drumsHarold Land - tenor saxophoneRichie Powell - piano (Bud Powell's brother)George Morrow - bassI don't see the need in writing long reviews on recordings that don't need any convincing. This is one of them. Either you're a jazz fan or you're not. If you don't own ""Brown And Roach, Inc,"" then you're not."
"Think of this album as a genius engineer building a masterfully powerful machine...out of an erector set. 'Selling Live Water' has powerful, very raw and clangy, beats. Sole's voice is that of anger, frustration, and insight, but overall you can really here a guy having fun. He creates incredible lines without using any proper rhyme scheme; his formula is to be dead on with the beats, and at that he is incredible. While Sole's rapping skills cannot be argued with, I must say that the beats are the star of the album. Of all the hip-hop albums to emerge lately this one is 2nd only to El-P's 'Fantastic Damage'. Exceptional songs include 'Da Baddest Poet', 'Salt on Everything', and 'Plutonium'."
"I experienced similar problems that others have described. The charger will stay on charge all day long but give only a few minutes worth of extra power to the NDS when switched to play mode. It also gets noticeably warm, almost hot, in that center battery area while in play mode.I called NYKO for support and was informed that the item has been discontinued. There is no other similar product offered by the company for the NDS. I was offered a measure of credit towards any other product on their web site but the only items for NDS amounted to a light-up stylus and a camouflage carrying case with a matching car charger. Hardly a replacement for a charger grip that would have been amazing for that upcoming 11-hour overseas flight.So I'm out ten bucks because the retailer has no more for exchange. I can either hack the device to try to fix the battery or take a chance wasting another ten bucks for a possible working device. Now where's that tri-blade screwdriver?"
"I'm sorry, I just couldn't stay awake reading this thing. It was confusing, boring, and annoying. I had high hopes when picking it up: I like historical fiction, I like reading about science and scientists, and I've generally found Irish writers (at least those available in the US) to be to my liking.Skip this one."
"When I ordered the Encyclopedia, I resigned myself to slugging through mountains of information and end up ""What did that say again?""Well, I am pleased to say that there was the mountain of information and more often than not I knew what it was saying. The definitions in were to the point, crisp and relevant to the times. Rev. P. Stravinskas had the insight to include information an ordinary Catholic needed at 7PM Sunday in a mad rush to complete an assignment.Where the encyclopedia lost me were in some definitions that were necessarily lengthy. Obviously, some white space could have saved me time in re-reading the whole passage. But, with the value of the information included, I believe the Encyclopedia is an excellent resource for those of us who are not scholars in the catechism of the Catholic Church."
I am not for or against drinking but the author of this book comes across as a drunk that is against prohibition. Aside from repeatedly stating that it stripped our rights to drink it really didn't say anything. Glad it was free
"Does he play Beethoven at all? If you like Beethoven piano concerto, please listen to Backhaus, Schnabel, Fischer or Perahia!"
"E. Lynn Harris never disappoints and he steps up to the plate once again. I loved the story by Jerome Dickey...the characters Kenya and Amir were such a great pair. The Cafe Piel was good...the ending was a bit unrealistic, but the storyline was good. The short story by Channing was awful...I could not finish reading it...I did not know where he was going with the story...this story is why I rate the book a 4 and not a five."
"I cannot believe that people would give this film 5 stars. I forced myself to watch the entire film just because I could not believe that someone would actually recommend this film. Yea it has an interesting twist, but it gets real painful after a while. If you love it, god bless..."
This book is not nearly as good as what I thought it would be. Stopped reading it after the 2nd chapter. Going to donate it or sell it at my garage sale.
"Like so many others, it just up and stopped working (tonight) after 7 months.Prior to tonight it had been absolutely great, although the lack of an off switch is kind of lame. I saw a Wolfgang Puck panini press on TV that looked cool. Stood on its side when not in use and had an on/off button."
"We are very happy with the headphones. We can have people who are hearing impaired hear the TV, and computer without blasting out the other people in the room! Yea! Worth the price and value!"
"For Bette Midler fans, this project is just like any other Midler project. So they would enjoy it just the same.But for Rosemary Clooney fans like me, its a complete dissappointment. Choosing the Rosemary Clooney Songbook for this album is totally wrong, since the late Miss Clooney was the queen of songbooks herself..."
My machine wouldnt recognize the card. Total waste of my money. I have the new slim PSTwo machine... I DO NOT recommend this to anyone. Do yourself a favor and just buy the regular memory cards.
"I actually really like this book, but I think you do need the extra guidance of a professor when using it. It's very easy to look up the pharmaceuticals and all related info, and I was actually able to use it easily when taking the open book section (looking up the pharms) of a pharmacotherapeutics test. I would definitely recommend this book."
I was excited to order this for my 10 month old grand son. When I received it I was a bit disappointed. Although the toy seems nice and I am sure that he will love it but it is supposed to be a Christmas gift. It did not come in its own box. The shipping box is not in the best shape. I have to go find a box to wrap it in. How come in does not have a box of its own. I do not want them to think that I bought a used one!! I have no idea what to do!!!
"...to even think of blaming libraries. Maybe if high powered political figures on library boards across America didn't feel the need to make their served institutions ""All Things to All People"" and got back to core values, and if the American public could turn off American Idol and reality TV long enough to end the Reign of the Retard, there would be the support for libraries needed to house all the items ever published anywhere, and every Podunktown can have it's own Library of Congress. Guess you've truly made it when you've sold enough books you can bite a hand that feeds you, Mr. Baker.However that does not detract from the quality of his writing, stellar as usual."
"If you are familiar with the characters Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb, there is really no mystery here. But, as they say, it's not the destination that is important, but the journey itself. Connelly's writing is fast paced and streamlined. We are not given large doses of non-essential information just to prolong the story, as happens with quite a few other authors these days. We learn a little more about Harry but he remains a mystery, and that is the hook. A journey well worth the effort."
"I couldn't wait to see how it ended. (To me, it was more a book where I wanted to know how it ended, rather than just drinking in the current part of the story - it really pulled me along). Once it did, I'm sorry that it's over. It's in my head now - I keep thinking I can go pick up my book and read, then I remember I finished it, and my heart sinks a little each time."
"While Patton had flaws, and they are clearly presented in this excellently-written biography, I found his story full of high interest and one could not help but feel glad that Patton was present when he was on the battlefields where he served. This is an excellent work, well matching the other D'Este works I have read: Decision in Normandy (read 5 July 1992) and Fatal Decision (read 29 June 2003). Patton did heroic things but there is no need to admire his flaws--and that includes his belief that crude and foul language somehow made him a better man and general, and that he thought he knew more about mental damage than doctors. But this is a great and enjoyable book to read and I revelled in it."
"What else can I say - I've never gotten the DVD I ordered, The Wings of Eagles.Joyce"
"After reading this book for my October bookclub meeting, I was hard pressed to find out what all the hype about this book was about. While there were aspects of the book that were thought provoking, I failed to see the merit this book supposedly has. I also found myself wondering why his conversation was worth publishing. I found it interesting that on many occasions when the book got boring, which it often did, I could jump around and not lose a beat....that's not saying much. In the end, I just did not like the book very much, again, aspects of it were thought provoking, but all in all I'd not highly reccomend this book. The Road Less Traveled was better."
"Do not go on the website suggested by Hooked on Gadgets, it is a spam sending and fishing/phishing site that will try to steal your identity and send you LOADS of junk mail."
"that all i have to say... this is film dont worth more of my attention, I hate it! I would like it if i thought killing is verry fun, but if you americans love this kind of films enjoy yourself, this is not the kind of cinema that I want..."
"Bought these for my two adult chins. The male is tiny, but he was somewhat cramped in it and only used this until I added a fleece house - now he only uses this for a platform. It's also not heavy or stable enough for them to use as a platform - on shavings it will tip slightly and startle them when they jump on it. Additionally, they jump on it with enough force that the top comes off daily, so eventually I had to nail it down so they wouldn't fall on it awkwardly.The female is much longer than the male, and she looked really uncomfortable in this whenever she had to turn around in it. She too abandoned it, and I didn't even give her an alternate nest box.I know the price is attractive, but now I have two houses that I'm going to pull out and replace with more substantial, large boxes. I definitely don't recommend this house type at all."
"I really liked the form factor and features of this unit, and was excited to have my first truly wireless mouse for my recent 12"" Powerbook purchase. Unfortunately, I found the response time lagging slightly and cursor tracking not as smooth or as fast as my Macally iOpti Jr. mouse, so (ultimately) it proved unsatisfactory. I also found problems with having to continually go back into the Bluetooth Pref in order to wake the mouse after the computer went to sleep and was re-activated, but did not pursue a fix since the performance was sub-par anyhow. I have returned this, and will try someone else's Bluetooth mouse until I find one the responds as well as a USB mouse (or give up entirely)."
"I bought this RCT3 soaked because my son loves RCT3 so much. As soon as I installed it, it crashed both the Soaked and the original RCT3. Neither would work again. I was getting 'bad version 4 ' error and asking me to install a disk I already had installed . There is NO customer support for Atari games! No one answers their phone and no one responds to my e-mails. It is trash."
"The switch fit perfectly and works great, but it sure would be nice if they would write better installation instructions."
"Bought this from Amazon in March 2006. It worked for a few days then died. To make a long story short it took Panasonic 3 months to resolve the situation. They finally ended up buying the TV back. Usually I have had good luck ordering electronics through Amazon, but remember you can't send big TV's back to Amazon even if it breaks a few days after buying (this policy was disclosed when I purchased the TV so I am not complaining about this, only Panasonics Service). I took the refund and bought an LCD TV direct from a prominent computer maker. They have an advance exchange service policy which is a better option for this kind of purchase."
"Evelyn's latest release and contribution to the ""...Late Night"" compilation is quickly making it up to my 'Best of' list for this series.My only question is why the dialogue at the end? I never have cared to listen to it."
it is so nice to have filtered hot and cold water - i use it every day - the filter was so heavy when I removed the old one to put the new one on.
I love this set. I have used the small one to crush pills I have also used the large one to make small amounts of mayo with garlic or shallots for a recipe. I also crush dry bread crumbs for a single piece of fish and herbs. This set is good for those small to slightly larger tasks. I find I am reaching for these more often than my larger one.
"This movie arrived quick. Which is always a good thing. I hate when it takes forever for a movie or purchase to get to my mail box. When I bought it used I was afraid that it would come with scratches and would skip certain scenes, so I would have appreciated it if I had known if it was going to have several scratches. Other than that it has been a very good purchase and I am pleased with the product."
"If you own these bottles please pay close attention to the little vent holes/slits in the bottom disc. I was just washing my bottles and was horrified to realize that there was a black mold like substance in the slits. I wash them better than they recommend, I hand wash and boil all the pieces. So why is there mold forming in the slits? I'm getting rid of all these germ infested bottles and going to buy a better designed bottle. Oh...they don't prevent air bubbles any better than any other brand. Just don't waste your money on them."
"This product was frustrating to try to use, the software didn't work, and tech support was very unhelpful, and expensive, considering you waited on hold on a non-toll-free number. I returned it and went with the ATI Radeon All-in-Wonder 7500, which I love."
I have read every single book by Karyn Monk and I have loved all of them except this one. I didn't even finish the book it was so bad. The heroine was annoying and condescending towards the hero and the hero eas just a washed-up has been. The characters just did not work for me. What happened to the magic she so aptly displayed in all of her other books? Well I guess every author writes at least one unsatisfactory book or two.
"Although the story is about famous Z-writer/director Edward D. Wood Jr. and his many mishaps while trying to become a well-received mainstream filmmaker, the heart of the story is the touching friendship between Ed and Bela Lugosi.Excellently acted, written, directed, photographed, and scored, Tim Burton's ED WOOD is certainly the auteur's best, personal works next to VINCENT and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS: all the stories of misunderstood outsiders.Martin Landau's Oscar-Winning, scene stealing Bela Lugosi is not to be missed:PULL THE STRING! PULL THE STRING!"
"I read this book shortly after it came out 14 years ago, and it's stuck with me all these years. I won't say its the greatest book I've ever read - there were definately some slow points and characters that seemed to be a bit TOO odd or maybe even unnecessary - but it is definately a VERY GOOD book, one I would recommend to anyone looking for some nice escapist fiction that can get you thinking in unusual ways. It offers some very nice twists and turns and was quite and enjoyable ride. It's not every book I remember 14 years after first reading it."
"I wore these for one day only. The rubber chafed against my ankles until my skin was rubbed off. So, don't wear these without socks. In addition, they just weren't very comfortable at all. It felt like I had a bunch of hard rubber nipples pressed against my foot (and that's pretty much what it was). I guess if you want shoes that you can spray off with the garden hose, then these will work for you. But, if you want something more comfy, try Teva, or Keen."
"I truly enjoyed this book, but their second book is better. While I agree that I would like Emily to be a little more ""forceful"" in the book, I believe it truly depicts some of the struggles a young, Christian woman would have in NYC. I found it funny and inspiring. I would recommend it as a gift for any young, Christian woman who is going off to college or life after college. Asks some good questions, that are not always easy to answer!"
"The protagonist of this book mentions a Latin quote: ""No old man forgets where he has hidden his treasure"" Well....in this case it seems that Marquez has forgotten exactly that: the place where he has hidden his superb skills as a narrator of fascinating, magic realistic stories.The novel is a shallow, disappointing story about a 90 years old bachelor and his love for a teenage virgin he likes to watch while she sleeps. The magic atmosphere of the small South American city which is Marquez forte in other novels feels like a strained recycled background to an unsatisfying story.Is it possible that like Salvador Dali at old age allowing young painters to imitate his style, this book was written by a ghost writer while the old master nods his head slowly in the heat of an afternoon siesta in Macombo ?"
"The autor writes too much about the research subjects. She should place more attention on the conclusion and elaborate more about it with her personal experience. Certainly, her own experience also counts.The book is like a research paper, a thesis. It is not easy to read."
ever wanted your intelligence assumed to be zero? ever wanted to read a bill ayers book? have nothing better to do than support a fraud? this is your book.
"Amazon replaced it with a second unit after the first one had issues with the ""Wake To"" button. I could not choose between iPod, Radio or Buzzer to wake up to. The second unit arrived and it worked fine for a few days and then the ""Wake To"" button stopped working again. Too bad, because the rest of the functions are OK and its sound is very nice. I ordered a full refund. What I can't complain about is Amazon's service, they are the best, they deserve 10 stars!"
"Right-wing commentators are being asked during the month of April to go five minutes or more without mentioning Bill Clinton in their ""Clinton Free Month"". Said one NAB fficial, ""Clinton left office three years ago, yet pundits like Hannity, Limbaugh, and Coulter can't go more than five minutes without mentioning his name. It seems a sort of psychological malady. We are doing this for them, to try to ween them off their weird Clinton obsession in the hopes the national dialogue improves a little."""
"As described, fast but quiet, the electric motor keeps up to long hours of fun. I recommend this bike."
"Irony, agony, and love are the major elements in Peter Hargitai's novel, Atilla: A Barbarian's Love Story. Atilla's struggle to free himself from the shackles of the past customs is an emotional rollercoaster.His post-modern fiction would be appreciated by generations who find themselves agonized by people's rejections of the joining of multicultural societies. Some may criticize the novel for the ordinary love story, however, it's what makes it worthy to read. Peter Hargitai was anything but close-minded about the current ""melting pot"" in America, and this is what the world needs. Even if the beginning may not be in sync with the rest of the book, it's a nice sense of Hungarian history. Despite some technical errors, the overall jist of the novel is enjoyable."
"Being a corporate executive I belived I had to be one person in my personal life, and yet another in my work life. This book helped me to realize that was not true. ""Work and the Human Spirit"" is a powerful example of the strenght, excitement and dedication one can find if the bring all they are into the work place. It's a must read if you find yourself expereincing the same sturggle."
"He wrote about 3 songs in the eighties that were alright, but he is just not good. I would not buy an entire album of his. There are much better artists out there that leave him in the dust."
"I enjoy everything prison related. Not sure why, but I have a total fascination with the world of incarceration. This book was one of many that I enjoyed. Written in a simple and easy to read format it is a book that you can read in a day or two and not miss a beat. It is a good account of what life is like on the inside, or rather, what I would imagine it is like. If you enjoy a read about life on the inside, you should pick this one up. Enjoy!"
"This little book hits the spot for preteen & older readers. It's graphically colorful, with a variety of interesting photos & illustrations; it's written conversationally, yet with enough factual citations to validate the unbelievable, heroic stories; and, it introduces the reader to a cast of amazing female characters mainly unheard of in contemporary American culture.I bought it to send to my grandchildren, but was captivated into reading it myself. I learned a lot."
"""Rain"" is a classic pre-censorship movie of the 30's. As usual with this type of film, one must do a fair amount of reading between the lines to get the full story. Joan Crawford gives a strong performance as Sadie Thompson, a trollop on the run from the law. Walter Huston as Alfred Davidson, a bible thumping, over the top preacher, is sufficiently scary. The rest of the cast puts in fine performances. The cinematography is also exceptionally elegant.The story is a bit watered down from it's Somerset Maugham original, and some extreme leaps of believability are needed on the part of the audience to accept the denouement. But the story is strong and powerful and surprisingly up-to-date considering it is almost 70 years old. It would seem the religious right has been throwing its muscle around longer than we think.I highly recommend ""Rain"", if for no other reason than to see Joan Crawford in the type of role that made her famous."
"Superb! That's the only word I find to qualify this excellent compilation. Once you buy it, stop listening to it becomes impossible. The day it arrived I listened to it three times in a row. I've known only ""I like Chopin"" from the 80's, I think no other music from Gazebo has been played on radio in Brazil during all these years. I simply got astonished because all the other musics from this cd are quite so good as ""I like Chopin"". And I finally could get a original version of this classic song, both single edit and the LP version. I only had the remix version from the 90's. I really loved ""Wrap the rock"", ""Gimmick"", ""For Anita"" and ""Telephone Mama"". Although the price of 29 dollars plus shipping and the 60% tax I paid to my country's customs it was completely worthy awhile. Thanks for Amazon and Gazebo for this really enjoyable cd !"
"I am so glad there are other people who miss Nick Fox. I was really surprised when the author decided to kill him out of the series. He and Jess were the best couple and i really wished he would have stuck around. I haven't read this book, infact i stopped reading Sweet Valley University after Your Not Sister so i really have no idea who Sam or Neil are, but i was happy when I read the reviews of other people that said the author should bring back Nick Fox."
"14th edition (January 1999) is now 5 years old, so this book is woefully out of date for anyone looking for streets added or changed in the last SIX years (assuming that when a book comes out, it already a year out of date). Hey ADC, how about a new edition!!"
"If your a FireFly fan buy it now. The shows are great, good sound, widescreen (Fox never showed'm that way) and lots of the plot arc of makes sense (since Fox showed them out of order so things were very strange). The only complaint is the quality of the DVD Menus and such. The graphics just have a cheap feel and the selection 'bug' disapears into the background from time to time. Not a fatal flaw, but glaring compared to the quality of the shows.The missing espisodes explain alot too - why Irna was leaving at the begining of 'Objects in Space' (my fav) and more of Mal and Zoe's history. Plus of course you get to see a real live alien (or is it.....)Enjoy"
"The Complete Book of Food Counts is essential to any successful healthy lifestyle. It is concise, clear and helpful in every way. I just had gastric bypass surgery and this book was recommended by my surgeon to help guide me nutritionally as I begin my new journey to eating right. This book will enable me to do that."
"I'm not just being snooty ... I really didn't like ""Plan B"". The story's transparent plot is an excuse for the main character to reminisce about how wuuunderful his college girlfriend was and boo-hoo about how she dumped him and he got married on the rebound. He should have saved it for his junior high school-style diary."
"this Christmas was extra special when the pogo stick was the first to arrive. My granddaughter, who knows a whole lot more about computers than I, just thought I was the greatest because I shopped on line. Thanks, amazon for making this a terrific help when time is of the essence."
"This is a terrible book. Yes, it provides you with a broad overview of the history of Christianity, but it is scattered and badly organized. It gives focus to what seem to be some random movements, events, and beliefs in the Christian history while neglecting others. It needs editing for consistency and to clarify run-on sentences and poorly illuminated points."
"This ""heavy duty"" stapler is anything but. The tab holding in the staples is a light piece of plastic that breaks off after a year or two of use. How dumb can they be making a heavy duty metal staple dependent on a crappy little plastic tab"
I just want to say that I love Ciara's first album Goodies. She sings about real situations and has a beautiful voice. Her music is real and really applies to teens today. I rep her to the fullest!
"This story was a huge letdown! Although, I'll admit, this started out to be a page-turner. Which was fast-paced, gory, gruesome, and very intriguing. Just the way I like em, so I thought. But, it didn't seem to want to slowdown, it kept right on going and going, leaving the ending rushed and lacking drama. The story completely dies. No suspense, what so ever, not a typical Patterson novel. And, furthermore, to make things worse, in an effort to pick it back up, which, should've been another story altogether, we discover who's the Mastermind. And, that also is a disappointment."
"Loved this story,could hardly put the book down. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting an interesting story."
the voice actors were all a great choice! The rest just don't put yourself through the pain of watching it just re-read the books :)
"There is no doubt that the man formally known as Harry Houdini led an interesting life. Sprinkled throughout this book are reminders of such. And yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. Events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. Instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in Houdini's life. Relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. Also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. I would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.The book is enjoyable only insomuch as Houdini's life was fascinating. Too bad the complete effects of this interesting life are lost within the puzzle of pages."
I bought this sylvania DVD/VCR recorder/player last year for my husband and lately all the DVD player does is scramble the DVD's
At last a children's book that doesn't raise your blood sugar! Great illustrations and a memorable way to present the counting concept. I wish there were more books like this and the companion Mouse Paint.
"Some time ago, I had a really bad case of diarrhea. I thought that after I flushed the toilet, it would be gone forever. Little did I know that Sarah Palin and her handlers were siphoning from the sewage pipes of Los Angeles County and repackaging it into a 'documentary.'Leni Riefenstahl couldn't have made a film with more right-wing propaganda than this piece of garbage."
Danielle Steele writes another diversionary read with a fun happy ever after ending! I love this kind of book for a quick mental getaway. Read it in one sitting and think of it as the perfect style writing for women who just need a quick fun pick up. Entertaining and fun to read.
"We consumed our way into our current mess and it is the height of folly to believe we can consume our way out of it. Privatization (read commodification)is definitely not the answer. The reason the author comes to the conclusions he does is that it is just too difficult for him to give up his current lifestyle. Showing us that recycling doesn't work is easy. Recycling is what happens when we commodify something like garbage, so let's commodify everything and that will solve our other problems just as effectively. Read 'Divided Planet' if you want a really well written book on the subject."
I bought this from Amazon a couple years ago. It still works great and I enjoy it very much. It is one of my favorite things. Seeing those rainbows in the early morning (I have it in an east window) brightens the beginning of the day.I would think these rainbow makers would also be great for people who are bedridden or don't get around much. Several elderly people I know have taken great delight in watching the rainbows move about their room.
"I enjoyed this book, but I still like Stephen King's The Stand better. The main reason is that the characters in Swan Song did not have enough depth. They were either ""good"" or ""bad."" I would have liked to see some of Swan's bad traits and some of Alvin's good traits, for example. Very few people, if any, are either purely good or purely evil in real life, and I felt that this is where Swan Song lacked credibility. Sometimes I actually felt like cheering for the bad guys because Swan was just too sugary sweet. Other than that, it was a decent book, worth reading."
"I got this and the first thing I noticed is that the usb interface was bent, like if someone did it with pliers. I fixed it with a butter knife, but I didn't like the fact that I had to do this.."
"This is a great headset for your Blackberry (I use it on my Pearl). Sound quality is good enough for music and calls and it actually makes it easier to listen to your phone calls. The microphone isn't great and picks up a lot of wind noise, unlike many of the sound canceling microphones out there.However if you live in California (and possibly other states that require hands free wireless in the car), don't cover both ears while driving as that's could result in a ticket. Either only use one earphone of the 2, or use a different headset in the car."
I read the first few chapters and didn't care for this book at all. The wording was not something I cared for. I took a chance for $.99!
"Great movie, even beter if you are familiar with the bible and not afraid to challange your faith."
"I never use this ""Speed Loader"" because I find it speedier to load by hand. Probably good in a gun fight but for the range, I will use my hands."
I used this guide several times while in amsterdam recently. It was a great book to use to familiarize myself with the city and get an idea of what I was and wasnt interested in doing.The information is straight forward and useful. I recommend this book.
"I've had this TV since August 2003 for $3100 CDN. I am writing this now in June 2011. I have never had to replace the lamp and it's still working fine. It is my main TV and I would guess that I watch on average 2 hours a day (conservative estimate). that's over 5600 hours.I've noticed over the past few months the warm-up period of it turning on is getting longer; probably signs that I will need to buy a new lamp. Buying a new lamp off of ebay for $125 Canadian.I know there are a lot of reviews giving it a bad rating, but I really can't complain. I got my moneys worth and the picture is still really good. I have a blu-ray player with DVI connected to it and looks great. I really wonder how long I'll keep the TV since the technology is getting old. Maybe I'll move it to the bedroom when I can't resist buying a new slimmer LED TV."
"Almost pointless video. The majority of the time they discuss investing down in the keys or Florida, this video was obviously made during the real estate boom in Florida, I can now see why Florida is in so much trouble. Anytime you have ""real estate investors"" like these people you're bound to create problems. No information on multi family."
"Headphones have terrible design - do not sit in ears, always drop out. I cannot use it. Do not loose your money."
"HELLO?! Amazon? What is going on? How old, what weight/height should my child be PRIOR to using the seat? OR WHEN SHOULD MY CHILD NOT BE ALLOWED ON IT!? WHEN IT BREAKS AND SOMEHOW HARMS MY CHILD?

"I have never written a review for a book before and have read a few hundred books over the last few years. This by far is the worst novels ever put in print and deserves to be outed. I am not even sure that the publisher should not be punished for allowing this to go to market. There is no real story and Jason plays almost no part in this book. It is almost as if the writer took out a thesaurus and scrambled the most complicated words and ""created"" a book. I could not even begin to explain any portion of the several senseless ramblings of stories that make up this book."
"This book is digusting. One of the reviewers says ""this is what makes gay men gay"". Ay mi Dios! It's more like ""this is why society hates us"". Two men with no restraint or reserve, who will do anybody anywhere. The weirder or kinkier the better. Out in public, no concern for their HIV+ status.It is scary to think that some gay men operate this way. I could barely finish the book did but and will now throw in the trash as I don't want anyone else to read this."
"Kinsey does it again! She's the queen of the supersleuths ... ""B is for Burglar"" is B-eautiful"
"I had the same experience as the previous 1 star user. This was a replacement for the identical product which lasted 7 years. This unit lasted 3 months (it beeped once occasionally even though the test was fine). We replaced the battery, blew compressed air into the unit as is recommended in troubleshooting guides, to no avail. Unfortunately we no longer have the box to return it since it has a 5 year warranty."
My daughter loves the game but the game kept freezing up until it didn't work anymore. We had to purchase another one at the store. The game is fantastic according to her.
"I am more than an avid fan of Mr. Martin Cruz Smith. I own a complete collection of his works. Either I read the book hype wrong or else I have mis-judged Mr. Cruz Smith's ability as a writer. Except for the excerpts by established time honored writers: Mark Twain, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Guy de Maupassant, I find the book mundane, deplorable and a disappointment that Mr. Cruz Smith attached his name to it. I found bad usage of grammar, stories that lost the development of the plot, confusion of character identification (Frederick ?)and just poor mystery writing overall.Amaturism personified. Mr. Cruz Smith, did you read the book before you affixed your name to it? I will gladly sell it if I thought I could recoup my costs. This shakes my confidence in Mr. Cruz Smiths future writings and whether or not I may purchase them."
"One of the most boring and stupid books I`ve read in a long time. Full of ignorant remarks. From Mr Clancys observation that asian girls like westerners because they are better ""equipped"" than the asian males, via people saying Comrade Doctor etc to each other in Russia, ten years after the Soviet Unions fall, to the ""fact"" that american girls are slimmer and healthier than the rest of the world(when we know that they are sicker due to overweight than the rest of the world). Well, a writer can write about his white supremacy but when he writes as boring as Tom Clancy does in this book it gets completely uninteresting. Just pure typewriting and after 350 pages I had to give up.  Yes, and I spell terrible..."
"This cd let me down so much. I havent really like staind since break the cycle but I thought Disfunction and Tormented were amazing so I always give them a chance. I figured maybe staind had gone back to the more heavier songs but nope. It also seems like a lot of the songs on here sound alike. If you ask me DO NOT buy this cd, total waste of money."
Great price for the Wii remote controller. Most stores charge full price on this so it was pretty nice finding a deal for less than full price. Works great and shipped quickly even with supersaver shipping. Great job by Amazon.com!
"When I got my E-115, I bought the portable handheld printer at the same time. It works wonders. With small companies you can print out receipt. You can make business cards on the go. Hand someone a really great looking note which the will never lose. Really it work with any windows CE PDA that has a IrDA infrared port. With 64 different shades of grey and 400 dpi this isn't one of those black and grey printers. The one problem I had was power, it chew up batteries, like a cat and mouse, it's best to buy those rechargeable batteries right away. Just think, if you ever run out of paper the Freedio stores the print command in it's memory and prints it later when you have enough paper. It makes a great partnership with the FZ-700S scanner, once a document is scanned it send it via the IrDA port and prints the document. This is a great buy."
A wonderful book that gave me a greater understanding of the evolution of religion. A must read for serious questioners of theology.
"Have been looking forward to this cd for 14 months! It was August of last year when Ludacris was talking about Chicken and Beer from the stage during Anger Management tour. Well, then it was supposed to come out and they kept pushing it back...until now! Guess he kept trying to improve it and finally gave up. This ain't NEARLY as good as his others. Weak beats, weak raps, weak overall energy wise. Stand Up is the catchiest outta 17 tracks and it ain't THAT great. The song with Snoop is just dreadful. Why would Snoop let himself get hooked up w/that track?"
a damn shame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a fake odb of the wu tang clan. i highly doubt the a&r still works for the label. this could cd have only sold 2 copies :to him and his mama!!!!!!!!!!!
"Robert Fomon was my grandfather, I dont understand this mans bias against a man he didnt know. My grandfather died when I was in 3rd grade, and this is not how I hoped he would be remembered. Despite the mishappenings dealing with EF HUTTON, I would appreciate all those to refrain from posting rude messages on the morals of my grandfather, for the same reason I would not critisize a family member of yours who I knew nothing about."
this product was as expected and instead of paying over a hundred dollars we got almost the same thing for 13
"Anyone who has wondered about the secrets of youth should do well by reading this book and focusing on a new reality inside the human body: the power of our vital glands. In the East, these are called ""chakras"" and they are thought to be energy-producing and energy-absorbing centers. The story, the exercises, the advice, and the claims posted by many people on the strength of tangible results, should not be overlooked. Simplicity here, is the key to an awesome power which lies within ourselves."
"One of the reasons I like spawn the most is because he is not a wus like superman, and batman. Not to mention those games stunk! But, back to spawn.___Pros___Great graphicstons of origional unlockable contentthe most origional enemies I've ever seengreat gameplay, extreme goreVast selection of guns and weapons___Cons___Story lacking in depthNow stop reading this review and go and buy it now!"
"Look this movie is a classic, with the big hats and the funky vibe, but why is this not on dvd with behind the scenes add ons. The shame!"
"Paula Begoun has built up an amazing business and marketing machine based on very little actual scientific fact and mostly biased opinion. If you've ever seen this woman give an interview ... well, let's just say her poor complexion and 80's makeup job speaks for itself. This is like the portly Dr. Phil writing a diet book and everyone flocking to read it.You've got to give the woman credit though. She's taken her opinion, common sense and sketchy science background and turned it into a very lucrative business."
"This is a nice keyboard. I would recommend it to regular customers. There are only a couple of things that I can say I don't like. The 5 buttons that you can use to assign to diferent applications would work fine if the software were a little bit more flexible. It is not compatible with Java applications. Its missing also the forward and back keys for the media player (I miss them a lot). Taking out these 2 things, the keyboard is fine. Its very confortable and easy to use."
"I have been attempting to purchase ""Room At The Top"" for several years, and was told that it was in the Archives! But I was really pleased to find this film on Amazon. I would highly recommend very interesting 50's film for not only the acting, but also the social mores that were so well conveyed. Great casting, cinematography, and superb acting. Hopefully, some day Criterion will fine tune this great flick!"
"Harper Collins released this small hardcover graphic novel based on L. Frank Baum's original book, A Kidnapped Santa Claus, adapted by Alex Robinson(Box Office Poison). The book was a followup to Baum's The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus which told Santa's origins. In this story, Santa gets captured by some evil demons, so a bunch his elves and fairy friends(including Zurline)mount a rescue. This actually turned out to be a great comic for young readers, and I highly recommend it as a holiday gift."
Much better than the first Eve 6 cd. everysong is good Reccomended if u like fuel and the foo fighters.
I'm only 1/3 through but this is one of the most boring books I've ever read. I'm forcing myself to read it only because of the money I spent to buy it.
"On this this 2-CD I've found some excellent tracks like Willie Nelson's own style version of ""I hear you knocking"" and Nora Jones' subtle version of ""My blue heaven"". But hearing all these great artists doin' Domino's repertoire made me realise again how BRILLIANT Fats' own versions are!"
"I have been a linguist now for six years and have studied Polish and Russian. ""Intermediate Polish"" by Oscar Swan is perhaps one of the most helpful books I have read. It contains a lot of information and presents it in a concise format."
"The sound was awesome - no question about it - but the headphones fell apart after 8 months. The cheap plastic used to connect the ear pieces to the head piece cracked and eventually broke, and now a sharp piece of metal sticks into my head if I ever wear them. I needed to tape them with hockey tape to hold them together.....I expect better for $300![Look in the product images for pictures of where they broke]"
"The first 10 minutes of this movie were rather amusing and after that it settled down to a real napper. Endless long face shots of Schimmer in particular looking concerned,pathetic,etc.,etc.made the film a test of one's staying power. Occasional humor and the interest generated by Paltrow and Hersey helped,but the movie was unsavable.A 25 year old with his weird mother and bunk beds,Paltrow's pathetic outfits and Hersey,s atrocious hair and truly strange behavior are just a few of the blots on this would-be landscape. Michael Rappaport and that Bitsy character trying to go over the top was also borderline offensive.As I review the film in my mind, Two stars might have been too high! Skip this one and enjoy an extra episode of Friends."
"I was very happy that Sita survived the stake. Even for my tastes, I thought the book was a little too bloddy, but I still wouldn't have written it any other way. I thought that Sita pushed Joel into being a vampire too much, but I liked that she saved him from a painfull death. Everything leads up to the climax in Eddie's house very well, and the next book follows precisely how it should"
With motor homes (and trucks) that have dual wheels it is critical that tire pressures be kept equal and at the proper psi. The Milton S976 is the most accurate gauge I have ever used. Its dual head is small enough to fit into the ports in the stainless wheel covers and makes it easy to reach the stem of the inside tire. You might pay a lot more for a gauge but you can't get anything better. The only down side is the size and weight. You won't be carrying it around in your shirt pocket.
"I'll start by saying that I've burned through seven other tripods. Cheap plastic parts and bolts that would strip while holding my bulky equipment have become the bane of my existence.Recently, I purchased a new Canon and had little left in the budget for a high-end tripod. Fortunately, the Sunpak has been a tank since I took it out of the box. The pod is lightweight and easy to carry, but very sturdy and quick to set up. The mounting plates (yes, two plates) packaged along with the tripod fit all of my gear and easy to use.I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great tripod in a salary-man's price range."
"These Cool Brew teas by Celestial Seasoning are wonderful . . . no need to boil water, fruit flavors are natural and delicious and not too strong, and they come in handy for traveling, too."
"I was lucky enough to find this toy at a garage sale and thought it was the cutest thing I have ever seen, especially when you push the button and the horse whinnies. The only problem is that my two year old does not weigh very much and therefore can't get it to move...I found that you have to put quite a bit of weight on it and then release that weight almost completely to get it to ""ride"" which may be difficult for very young toddlers...this horse may be perfect for a three year old or so though! Too Cute!"
"I got this shirt for working out.Why I like it:Light weightMoisture wickinghas reflective stripes on the back for night/early morning runninghas a good fit/shape.Wash and tumble dry, no special treatment needed.Had this for a year, I wear it regularly and still is holding together.Why I don't like it:White as we all know shows sweat stains eventually on the pits. I should have gotten a different color!"
This item came in a sealed bag but when opened it was greasy like it had already been used and it was dented. Don't waste your time and money on this inferior product.

"The landlord's Kit is an extremely well written guide to making more money and saving alot of headache in managing property.There are a ton of great ideas that really work.Mr. Taylor aka Mr. Landlord has been helping other landlords for years...it is great to see many of his ideas in book form. The forms,letters and notices are worth a fortune. Read this book and do what it says...it works!"
This is a FABULOUS read !!! I was mesmerized by the entire book regarding the story of the Band. It had me in tears at times !!
"The signal goes down, I buy this to increase my reception, but even at outside, the signal is worst than with normal antenna. Don't buy !!La señal se cae, compre esto para incrementar mi recepcion, pero aun estando afuera, la señal es peor que con la antenna normal, no lo compres !!"
"A true talent!! A new voice with an old soul, Norah Jones encompasses everything that can be classy about a contemporary artist. Using her sultry voice to create a jazzy feeling to old school covers or creating new classics, this album is a must in most any collection. It makes you want to light and candle and drink a glass of red wine."
"So much anthropology is caught up in the detached scientific method. People don't realize that for all its powers, that science has its limitations. Einstein realized that, but many lesser scientists in many fields don't seem to realize that. The author of this volume utilizes science -- to the extent that it works, but he strikes a balance by looking the spiritual aspects of societies from THEIR perspective.Native American Shamanism without bias. Extensively researched, with sources noted. Entries include reference to the culture group and/or tribe."
"It seems like Palahniuk is stuck in a lyrical rut that comes out more and more recycled with each novel, and although this was fine through the first five novels (with the exception of Invisible Monsters-which is probably slightly worse than Diary) it really bottoms out here.Insert comically dark one-liner here.Reinterate said one-liner every fourth paragraph.If anything, stick with Survivor, Choke, or Fight Club."
"The mix of country artists and heart-warming Christain Christmas songs add significantly to the Christmas spirit. From Alison Krauss and Emmy Lou Harris to Billy Dean and Toby Keith, the songs are sung with emotion and truth. Stresses the Real meaning of Christmas."
"I wanted a specific compostion by Pergolesi, and I received this.It is not as indicated on the cover. I wish I had never ordered this."
"Even when y ou dont use the unit, the battery drains itself rapidly. Reception is poor overall. I even tried the antenna headphones. I gave up, cancelled my subscription. If anyone interested send an email, will sell for half the going price."
I've been watching the Monarch of the Glen series from the beginning and Hamish Macbeth is listed in the Customers Who Bought this item also Bought ..... What a Great and quirky show and the highland scenery is brilliant. I love it and can't wait until more are available.
"This is trash, this is not worth the 500.00. You want to trash 500.00, send it to me, I have bills to pay"
"So, I picked up the first pair of Hard Case Crime novels (this and Block's Grifter's Game), expecting a good read. Let me tell you, brothers and sisters, I more than got it.This is a fast read, a white knuckle story of gangsters, hoods and a femme fatale who all suck the loner/outsider protagonist into a tough underworld. It is a trip to hell.One of the main strengths of the novel is its author's voice, who brings something of a modern sensibility to material that could otherwise be dated. Still, the book has a vintage feel to it. The piece works and works well. If you like James Ellroy's Bop Quartet, you'll probably dig this."
"I have long been a fan of Geoffrey Trease's historical novels, but this is - to my mind - one of the best he's ever written. (My personal list of favorites includes *Cue for Treason* and *Victory at Valmy* too.) This is the story of Paul, the son of a Roman legionnaire in Britain, who sets out on a journey to Rome, avoiding gangsters along the way, to take a message to the Emperor, and try to save an innocent man's life. It has everything: adventure, humor, and a lover's description of Rome. This book should not be out of print!"
"I purchased this Dutch oven about 4 years ago. We use it several times a month for roasts, soups, stews, etc. (perfect for cochinita pibil). Heats quickly and evenly and is easy to clean--even when you neglect to stir the contents and they burn on the bottom. Just a boil a little water in the bottom and the stuff lifts off. The only minus we have is that the inside is stained--but that's from the cochinita pibil, which braises in a red achiote sauce. This is at least as good as the other brands at a fraction of the cost. For me, it's a no-brainer!"
On the HCG diet and my skin was so itchy due to not being able to use any moisturizers. This product saved me. It doesn't have the greatest scent when you first apply but it quickly goes away and leaves your skin feeling amazing. It's almost like a protective barrier that lasts all day. Feels silky smooth. I will definetly purchase again.
"I'm a dental student studying gross anatomy. Usually, students don't have enough skill in disecting the cavador to all stuctures (arteries, muscles, vein, nerves) they've studied. This reference help me improving and completing my lab skill. Its pictures are all color. They're all real picture. All structure are all clear. (clean fascia very clearly) Some sturctures are dyed so they help you identify and understand it easier.It's the best lab reference book I've ever had."
"I just finished watching this and came away thinking this was one of the best movies of this type I have ever seen!Without going into the storyline...the film has a lot of subtitles since it is mostly Chinese speaking. But this only gives you an appreciation for the frustration of the lover who knows little chinese, and of his being part of a charade to fool your lovers aging and ill parents [which includes watching him kiss and marry someone else!]This film brings up all kinds of issues, such as gay acceptance, is lying ever good?, personal responsibility, growing up, abortion, respect, committment....And the wonderful thing is, it doesn't try to answer any of these. You come away sorta happy, kinda sympathetic for everyone, and rather sad that, in the year 2004, going to these sorts of lengths to hide who you really are is not so uncommon in real life!"
"To all the critiques out there, this is not a fad diet. Depriving people of the opportunity to read this book is depriving people of information that can make them healthier. This book does not claim to help you lose ""20 pounds by this summer !!"" It is a health program derived from Biblical precepts and adopted to modern life. It has certainly helped me with my digestion problems and has given me the energy that I didn't have before I started with this. Yes, organic foods are a bit more expensive and this diet does require a change of lifestyle, but hey...so does cancer and other diseases...so take your pick. It's about how to live healthier and prevent health problems in the future for you and your family.It has helped so many people, that there is a support group/community for ""Maker's Dieters"". http://makersdietclub.squarespace.com/"
"Practice test one:Score: Verbal: 506 Quantitative: 420Practice test two:Score: Verbal: 600 Quantitative: 480Practice test three (3 hours before taking GRE):Score: Verbal: 520 Quantitative: 500(This had me an emotional wreck the day of the GRE)MY ACTUAL First time GRE SCORES:Verbal: 720 Quantitative: 620My only belief is that this book and program is designed to convince you to buy the courses. That being said, the 30 minute math tests did make me feel like I had all day to do the quant on the GRE.I'm not sure this helped me very much. I think I would've been better off just with a math review book.AND it is full of typos at critical points. For example, in one QC test problem it says ""Circle 1 intersects Circle 2 and EXACTLY two points"" and the problem requires it to be intersected at exactly one point to be solved."
"This game represents the beginning of the end of the Star Wars franchise. It's not made by LucasArts and doesn't really have much to do with Star Wars at all.The game was not ready when I was Beta testing it one month ago and I highly doubt that any of the critical bugs are fixed yet. This is a ""serious"" game which requires alot of repetitive work and a huge time investment.Unless you are a student with nothing better to do all summer, don't buy this game. You need to invest at least 4 hours a day to be successful in the game.On the positive side, the combat system is alot of fun. Going on a hunting expedition with a bunch of other players is cool. But the tedious portions of the game far outweigh the fun factor of combat."
"This novel started off just fine. I was quite interested in the story and quite anxious to follow it along.The characters were interesting; the plot was quite entertaining and suspenseful. In his usual style, Dean Koontz kept me wondering about what was going to happen.However, the ending was so disappointing. I felt robbed of my time and energy. Maybe I have been spoiled by reading his more recent works first, but the ending left me staring at the page.Definitely not one of Koontz's better novels. He does have many more satisfying works."
"While the others in the Cole series are excellent reads, this one isn't even so-so. Run of the mill, boring political statement. Hard to believe it was written by the same man."
"The book is beautiful, the art is great, the message the book conveys is a very good concept for children to adopt; however, it failed to get much attention from my 6-year-old twin granddaughters. After offering to read the book to them several times, I finally gave up trying. They were not interested.In addition, there were several areas I felt were poorly edited."
"If you're not going to change your plan for 6 months, this is a great deal with any of Amazon's mobile phones. You may have to contact AT&T to change your plan and features once you have your new phone, but it's a fairly quick procedure. Good deal."
"This stuff is terrible! It's not hot & spicy in any way, unless you can count the coating of chili powder all over it & the bag. The jerky itself has NO flavor at all. I repeatedly tried it over and over, hoping it was just a bad piece/batch/bag, but it was all the same - terrible, terrible flavor. If you think this will be ANYTHING like Jack Link's peppered jerky, or ANY peppered/hot jerky for that matter, you're going to be very disappointed."
"This is a nice kit, have everything you need and, also I think it help the red cross; that alone can be a good reason to buy"
"The book starts off strong and finishes weak. It reminded me a lot of Addicted by Zane, but this author lacks the descriptions and feeling that should have been in the book. The book also is not very believable in certain parts and is going way too fast."
"This is just what my husband needed. he only takes pills at night and this way he can get a month at a time ready and then not have to mess with it again. When we go somewhere he just puts the dispenser in his bag, no need for a bunch of bottles."
"I started this book with fervor and hunger and ended with a ""toss out the window"" of the book and a vow to find a new author to follow. In his haste to complete this book John Grisham forgot that readers are not dummies and that we expect the author to be true to his characters and his audience. After reading this book, I've taken a long pause from Grisham. . ."
"Vampire Boys has plenty of boys, but you would never guess that they are vampires. This movie is pretty dull stuff. Even Twilight was better. And the actor who played Caleb was horrible. A lot of the dialogue was stilted, and there is very little action. I think the movie would have been more successful had it been called ""Pretty Boys"" instead. That's the point of this movie anyway. The point surely wasn't to entertain or to scare people. The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because there isn't an ugly person in the cast. That counts for something, right?"
"""Hostage to War"" gives a great understanding of the conditions that the prisions of forced labor camps and concentration camps went through. It is the true story of Tatjana Wassiljewa, who was 13 years old when the Germans separated her from her mother and younger sister. She was sent off to a forced labor camp where she suffered horribly under Hitler's vicious rule. She experienced things that are just mind boggling. Starvation, illness, and so much more. It shows how hard it was to grow up during World War II and survive. Tatjana was a true survivor and went on to become a teacher during her twentys. It was an interesting book if you would like to learn more about World War II."
"aside from the fact that the riddlin' kids are just all around awsome people (i have a signed drumstick from them!!) the riddlin' kids are kick ass musicians. their music is off the hook and impressed me, i'm not usually a fan of the so called ""pop-punk"" but i think the riddlin kids are more than that, this is definatly an album you want to own, i know i'm glad i do!!!"
"I will never forget my first experience with this book. I was substitute teaching in a first grade class right before Mother's Day. I had no idea what I was facing when I had to help the students ""practice"" their presentation of the book for their parents and ended up hiding behind the book with tears in my eyes as the children recited the rhyme. I gave it to my mom and both my grandmothers, one of whom I was privileged to help take care of in her final months. This book deeply resonates with everyone I know who has read it."
"I am not pleased with this product. The manual says it is supposed to load MP3, WMP, etc. formats - BUT IT DOESN'T!It only does MP3. I called the 800 number Tech Support line and was told by a recording that they were busy and someone would return my call within 48 hours - NEVER HAPPENED!I DO NOT recommend this product!"
"Not only does this book explain many hunches I've had for decades (like who's full of baloney versus not) but it is also a great tool for recruiting sales people. After reading this I""ve discovered that the most likely successful sales people (for my company) are a) those that come from low income, distressed, or limited financial means rather than b) children of spoiled high income/high consumption families.I just fired someone that fell into the latter category when this book reaffirmeed she was never going to be successful."
"Like the songs from Linkin Park and Goo Goo Dolls. Thought the other songs could've been better - a lot better. Especially the Transformes theme song. I do not like this version at all. The version by Lion on the original animated movie is much better.Also much better, and a more recent version, is a version of the song done by Black Lab. This should've been on the album and would've been good for the closing credits of the movie as well. [...] and you can hear their version (and see some YouTube videos of the song).I, too, hope an orchestral soundtrack of the movie comes out."
"This book does an excellent job at pacing you from exercise to exercise than into songs that play on what you've learned. Although the Travis picking style can be difficult to get your head around. I would suggest first taking some basic lessons from a guitar teacher comfortable with the Travis style, than get this book."
"i bought the cd just for yellowcard's gifts and curses.After hearing through the whole album, i believe this album is towards punk-emo-pop . i do enjoy the 2 suites on this album. I guess some of the ppl may be looking for the song featured in the spidey's trailer. too bad it's not included.my favs would be -gifts and curses- , -who i am- and -ordinary-Fans of this few emo and punk bands should get this album."
"This is another soon to be classic along with ""Market Wizards"" and ""New Market Wizards"". The traders in this book are top notched. It shows how you that others can trade consistently and be profitable. Trading when you understand the rules isn't being in Vegas sitting at the slots. It means being the house at Vegas. It gives me something to shoot for in my own trading."
"I love fiction and nonfiction books about Queen Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots, and their century. But this was a real disappointment. It didn't offer any new understanding of the time period or of Elizabeth or Anne's characters. The love scenes were awkward and embarrasing. They seemed gratuitous and out of place. Thank goodness there are other good books about this period out there. Check out Alison Weir, Reay Tannahill or Patricia Finney for good books set in 16th century England."
"I got this book when I just learned to play the prelude 1 c major, and thought I would look into others later, even though the majority of those preludes and fugues are far beyond my ability to play. Since then I have tried to play prelude 2 (I) and prelude 24 (II) that is extremly beautiful though not easy to play, and I have listened all preludes and some fugues from CD or midi files with this book opened in front of me. I realized how great Bach's music is. Only complaint is that the cover of the book isn't glued strong enough, which is now seperated from the content pages already after only a short period use. Also, the prelude 1 (book I) is probably the correct version, but I have seen from some other books the other version with an extra measure between bar 22 and 23. I now play it with the extra measure since it seems making sense to me."
"First of all I would like to say that this book deserves A LOT more than just 5 stars. It deserves the whole sky full of stars,.... and then some!I started reading this book for an assignment in 7th grade and had one week to read it. I didn't get it done though but I loved it very much. Two years later I found it at a library and decided to start reading it again. I got finished with the whole thing and I don't think I'll ever find a book better than it! It just touched the bottom of my heart and it made me cry when I got to the last chapter of it and I would recomend this book to anyone especially people who don't like reading because this would teach them that there really are totally AWESOME books out there and I would say that this is the #1 book in the world!!"
"Spoiler alert - if you saw ""Full Impact"" you know how this one ends, unfortunately the acting and special affects are not as good. Not even close."
"This is a great CD by a great band, don't get me wrong. It's just after listening to the excellent ""Introduction to Mayhem"" I expected a little more out of Primer 55. Still a great buy, and it only cost me $... on the day it came out at Best Buy! Any Primer 55 fan should own it, and definitely check out their older one. It kicks ...."
"I bought it for some insight on troubleshooting my PS2, disk read problems. Not much there, unfortunately. That in it's own self wouldn't be a killer, but the fact that the book is 2/3 ""guide to games"" cinches the deal. It's from 2001, so there are no games since then included in the guide. If you just bought a PS2 (like I did) and you find this for a buck at a flea market, it might be worth it."

"This is a very frustrating work for a beginner to try to use. It is very difficult to distinguish between a lower case ""C"" and an ""E"" as well as an ""L"" and an ""I""."
"UNLESS YOU LIKE TO READ DURING A MOVIE, DON'T BUT THIS ONE. IT IS ALMOST LIKE A FOREIGN FILM THERE ARE SO MANY SUB-TITLES TO READ - SO MUCH IS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE INSTEAD OF JUST ENGLISH. I SPENT SO MUCH TIME READING WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THAT I DIDN'T GET TO WATCH MUCH OF THE VISUAL."
We have a 110 lb Newfoundland dog who sheds lots of long hair. This vacuum is great on carpet and hardwood! Cleans far better than any vacuum I've tried. Only complaint is I need to use scissors to cut long dog hair from rollers about once a week (I use vacuum 1-2x per day).
"Does this include the portion that connects to the fryer itself? That is the part I need, I have the portion that goes into the wall and the picture only shows the portion I have. anybody know?"
My 9 year old daughter received the laser tag game for her Birthday. She and my 5 year old enjoy it so much that I have to take it away from them almost everyday so that they will do their homework.We are shopping around to purchase another set for Christmas and are having trouble finding it.What I like most is that they have to move around and get the exercise that children don't get just sitting playing video games.We live in Boston and it is cold here now but that doesn't stop them from asking to go outside everyday to play laser tag!I want to buy the extra set so that their friends can play too. (I don't mind playing either)I bet it will be fantastic to play in the summer months late at night!kpj
"I love Nora Roberts, but $6.99 is too much $ for only 288 pages, if I'm going to spend that much I want to read for more than 2 days, sorry!"
"Ok, so I went and bought an Action Replay MAX, I go home all happy knowing I will be able to watch movies from any Region and what happens? It doesnt work on a scph model 5001 ps2. Hello, can you people WAKE UP and recall all your crap or have the stores label them with a sticker that says NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SCPH 5001 MODEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HELLO????????"

This will come in handy while doing Modifications inside the house and on my maxi-scooter.I've owned these kind of tool before and I just needed to upgrade.I would recommend it to others.
"Google the table of contents, and you'll find virtually every story in this dreadful amalgamation of sequential non-sequitors somewhere online. Then again, don't and save yourself the eyestrain and nausea. Spare yourself the horror of first lines that not even the Bulwer-Lytton contest judges could stomach. Avoid the incomprehensible syntax, the superfluous verbiage, the repetitive and redundent tautologies that constitute the endless and pointless drivel that is this book. If someone gives it to you as a present, sever all contact with that person, regardless of the closeness of your former relationship, for your presenter obviously wishes you ill."
"maxim used to be one of the greatest magazine ever. now its just full of ads. hardly worth the price, even at 5 dollars a year. every other page is an advestisment. very disappointed."
"Here are some of my favorite Ann Coulter quotes that only proves the point that she knows nothing about politics and is a hack job just to make conservatives feel better about their views.""Liberals hate America""""Liberals hate all religion except Islam""""Democrats actually hate working class people""""Liberals hate society""""Even Islamic terrorists don't hate America like liberals do""Democrats will destroy anyone who stands in their way. All that matters to them is power""""Liberals can't just come out and say they want to take more of our money, kill babies, and discriminate on the basis of race""""liberals seek to destroy sexual differentiation in order to destroy morality""""That's the whole point of being a liberal: to feel superior to people with less money""""Liberals are crazy""Don't expect any of these quotes to make any sense at all. They were all written by Ann Coulter."
"I purchased the Ryobi Lawn Eddger for my Ryobi trimmer. On my second use, the Lawn Edger became stuck to the trimmer body.I tried 4 different local ""Authorized Ryobi"" service centers. None will accept a Ryobi trimmer in for ""warranty repair"". For the past 2 weeks, the only message I have been able to get on the ""Ryobi 1-800 number"" has been ""Due to heavy call volume... we request that you call back later"". Even the Ryobi web page is most of the time out of service or extremely slow.I would never consider buying any Ryobi (or products from the same family)."
"Armageddon is the best movie I have seen in a long time. I saw it 3 times in the theater and loved it each time. Ben Affleck doesn't hurt the movie, either :)"
I put Pertronix in all my classic cars. It's not worth the hassle of points when this is so easy AND reliable.
"While I thought this was something of a filler novel, it was still fun for those who appreciate a space twist."
"I love other Nicolas Sparks movies like The Notebook, Dear John, but for some reason this one didn't do it for me. Wanted to see it in the theater even, but glad I waited for home rental."
I didn't expect sound perfection but thought I would get a set of earbuds that we're durable - wrong! Sound is okay but the sound connection keeps going in and out. I will not buy another pair of these crappy buds.

"I've had acne since 4th grade. Despite being told I'd ""grow out of it"", I still have it at age 23. I've tried what feels like every over-the-counter product available. I was doing moderately well using Neutrogena products when I decided to try Klear Action. After 3 weeks most of the blotchyness was gone. After 2 months I had about 2-5 pimples a month that came and WENT QUICKLY. At the 4 month mark I tried to be cheap and use AcneFree. Big Mistake. All my progress went bye-bye. I went back to Klear Action and am VERY pleased with the results. I can finally wear red or burgundy with out it bringing out redness in my face! I use it twice daily religiously and will not bother trying any other product. This truely works!"
"I thought this film was going to be Herbie the love bug. To my suprise I was watching a zombie flick, So I'll go ahead and review. I had just picked up Morty from the nursing home and wheeled him in to see herbie. You see we fist made out to the original Herbie movie and thought we could recapture some of that zing. We must have gone into the wrong theater but it was too late to wheel morty out once the film started so we wouldn't bother everyone...I shouldn't have taken Morty to see it, at one part he screamed so hard his falsies flew out and smacked a young man's head in the seat in front of him. Morty also dropped his sippy cup he got so scared."
"it's very difficult to push the strings in order to play a song, you have to push it very hard !!!I sent an email to the company 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting for a response....Bottom line, I really don't like the guitar..."
This is based on the James Bond movie. I tried out the game and it seems to demand a lot of button-mashing. It looks like the graphics are good.
"This movie was well produced and has a beautiful, semi-fantastical setting (almost more like a village in France than India). The acting and cinematography were both very interesting, with some beautiful shots. However, it lacked the light-hearted comedy and story that attracts independent American viewers. My wife and I love seeing Indian movies about the conflicts between traditional Indian society and modernity. In these movies, the family is both part of the plot and oftentimes comic relief. However, I didn't laugh once during this film. It's a serious love story, but mixed with the dancing and fairy tale setting, it's hard to take seriously.A related problem is that this movie simply had too much singing and dancing. I know Bollywood movies tend to have a lot of singing and dancing, but at times this movie seemed to have more music video scenes than plot. I ended up fast-forwarding these sequences."
"Although the production values are up to Surrender's usual glossy standards, the sex scenes are so stylized (and so unrealistic) that they are totally uninvolving. Also, they're simply not as hot as in earlier Surrender films like ""Femalien"" and ""Virtual Encounters"", especially the girl-girl scene. In this film, it's more of an exotic dance than anything else.A final note -- the star, Shauna O'Brien, has unfortunately gone the implant route. Her natural body was a knockout (see the original ""Friend of the Family""), but now she looks preposterous. Too bad!"
"The Amazing Rhythm Aces third and fourth albums - compiled on this disc - are not the revelations that the first two albums were. That said, the music on this disc is better than 95% of what you will find in ANY music store - online or otherwise - anywhere in the world.Music fans have been waiting for this music for many years. Either one of these discs would be worth the price of a CD. To get them on the same disc is hitting the jackpot.The Aces blend country, R&B, and soul into a brew so potent that you'll surely find yourself addicted after just a listen or two.This disc is a MUST BUY!"
Telling Ain't Training is a well written book that covers the basics of designing and delivering training. I would recommend it to anyone who is becoming part of a training organization.
"Saying that this movie is slow would be an understatement. Molasses moves faster. I'm usually a bit leary of films written and directed by the same person and in this case I was right to be. Somehow I managed to watch the first 40 minutes without completely falling asleep. After that I started fast forwarding. As one reviewer said, it's an interesting concept done with very poor execution."
"I have had , and read this book before, Loaned it out, and it never got returned. This is an awesome book"
"This is a great collection of a few Clint Eastwood westerns through Universal. There are two disks with Two Mules for Sister Sara on it's on disk, with no double sided disks. All movies are in color and in Widescreen format and there isn't any linear notes or booklet with the DVD. These movies also star; Shirley MacLaine, Robert Duvall, John Saxon, Dick Van Patten, Mitch Ryan, Marianna Hill, Verna Bloom, Joaquín Martínez, plus others! Overall this is a great set of movies and if you don't have any of these films I would recommend getting this."
"I am a fan of dba & 65dba, in their incarnations AFTER this album. This album has nothing to do with their later electronic dance pop sounds. The only song on this album that resembles that sound is track #2, ""We Must Go."" This album is blatantly evangelistic in lyrics, and the music is very churchy ensemble music -- even in the realm of CCM, this is bad. Avoid this album. If you're looking for dba's electronic dance pop sounds, the 1996 album ""Bubble"" is a good choice, and is an album I still enjoy listening to. Much later I bought 1994's ""Shout"" -- not as good as ""Bubble"" but good enough for me as a dba fan."
This is a great item and the reason I chose it was the removable plates. It is so much easier to clean than the ones that you cant remove the plates.
"First let me say I know this album well, and it is essential for any fan of Ron Dante, or the Archies. The problem here is that the mastering is so godawful poor! It seems to be mastered from a record-and judging from the nauseating sound of all the side two tracks (6-10), the record used was pressed off-center!!! Artwork bears no resemblance to original, and mine came with a booklet but no tray card! Add to that the fact that 2 tracks are missing from the original release, and this makes the disc useless. Most Dante fans already have a copy of the vinyl, and that is a superior copy to own at this point. Wait for Ron to reissue this himself-he'll do better..."
...for musical singing. It gets on your nevers after some time and you simply have heard better versions of these songs by better singers often before
"Madden 2004 is a great game for the average EA Sports fan. There aren't many flaws and Madden is great with his commentary. The stadiums are of high detail. The gameplay is great. Sometimes it won't load. If you have run a different program before you play it, odds are it won't load either at the beginning or the end. I like the trophy presentation at the end of a victory in the Championship game or the Super Bowl. It's a great game with excellent commentary from Madden and Al Michaels."
"If you want a USB notebook cooler that's going to last a few weeks with minimal use, go right ahead. The plastic feet came off, the power light is a blue/purple strobe that could compete with local law enforcement, and the dual cords (power/USB) is cumbersome."
"I just received this hat in the mail. It's made of sturdy material and was stitched well, but the lines on the hat aren't where they should be. Kind of defeats its purpose..."
I have always been a major fan of this movie. I got the first DVD a couple of years ago but it was a bit of a hassle to get up in the middle and turn it over. I was excited by the new two disc version in which the entire movie was now on one side. GREAT I thought. Then the extra scenes popped in which totally were unnecessary and detracting from the plot. Gratuitous nudity and thin scenes that should have been left on the film edit floor. I cant understand what they substatially did for this great movie other than significantly dilute it. I guess I'll go back to my first DVD and just take a popcorn break when I have to get up and chnage sides
"What has Rush turned themselves to? This is a horrible CD, only that. There's no point in trying to justify these plastic, incoherent and comercial songs saying ""we're trying new ways"", ""this is our best album so far"", ""we do what gives us pleasure"". One only needs to compare it with ""Moving Picture"", ""Permanent Waves"" and a handful of others Rush recordings!!"
"After viewing this video, it seems clear that Christie Brinkley is a self-centerd, shallow, narcissist. No wonder she burned through four poor husbands."
"The movie was good, however not everyone is a fan of Nicolas Cage so not everyone will enjoy this movie."
This movie was more boring than In the Bedroom. Don't rent it. Don't buy it.
"I bought this cd back in February, it was then the Dynamite Hack Demo(it's now mass-produced as a cd by thier label,Farm Club). My cd does not have any label on it, but it is the same.This cd is great, I stopped listening to it back in late April, but it was in my cd player for OVER TWO MONTHS! --THAT'S HOW GREAT IT IS!"
Absolutely love it. I've been using MIDI for nearly 10 years now. This is my first compact MIDI controller and it's actually really really nice. And the software that comes with it is pretty fun.

Very good value. easy to understand and follow. interesting and fun format. teaches music theory so that anyone can understand it.
"Charles Stanley continues to be a great blessing in our lives, and especially with this book; it brings new understanding of the Holy Spirit and its purpose in our lives. You will be blessed, uplifted, and inspired when you read it!"
"""Giardino Armonico"" is one of the best ensemble I've ever heard. ""La follia"" concert is truly touching. I'm really happy of these cds."
We had an alert just days after we received our weather radio and it worked great! We intend to take it with us when we travel.
"Ordered 60x32, these are small compared to other brands of the same size - probably closer to a 56. Fat sizes shouldn't be hip-hugger cut - it doesn't even make sense."
"Everything in this DVD is wonderful--Helen Liang's technique is simply top-notch. My only critique is that for those unfamiliar with the snake style, the DVD lacks a step-by-step breakdown of how to execute each phase of the form. Some of the techniques and postures are rather complicated, and may require extra time and patience in order to be successfully digested. Don't let that be a put-off for getting this video, however; this program is really a delight once you have put in the time and figured out how to dance the dance."
"The thin cases are a welcome addition when you buy this ""upgrade"" edition. The picture quality of the DVDs is top notch. An outstanding collection."
"The book is a broad and detailed manual covering the entire list of restoration steps and processes, but what the book fails to account for are manufacturing differences created by the various GM assembly plants. An example is that a 65 Chevelle model from the Kansas City plant will have more undercarriage parts painted than the car assembled at the Fremont, California plant. The book tends to state ""the part appears this way and this way only"" on a properly restored car and makes no accounting of mid-year changes or manufacturing location difference. I certainly hope this book is never used to judge concours Chevelle restorations.For the restorer wishing to learn great deals of general information about restoring a Chevelle, this can be a good reference tool, it just needs to be taken with a grain of salt not not used as the sole source of restoration information."
"This is a waste of money, ripped apart after two workouts on a treadmill. Will make you sweat but will break apart after a couple of uses. I purchased the valeo neoprene waist belt instead for the same price and its lasted me 3 weeks, makes me sweat even more and hasn't worn yet."
Disney movies are tough to beat. This collection includes Kurt Russels debut to his long acting career. A highly recomended collection.
"I have a number of the firms dvds and have been using them for two years with great results. Bought this thinking I would step it up a notch but, the cueing is so bad you end up stopping to say WHAT!! The most disconcerting thing is that the steps are off the beat of the music and that drove me crazy. It's a tough workout if you can get in your own groove but I find myself using this the least of all the Firms workouts."
"Scott, keep WALKING, as FAR away as you can get from ever writing another book. You can't recap, your rants suck, and you get all pissy and whiny whenever anyone has a problem with anything you say or do. This is the worst book I have ever read, in any genre, including Chyna's book. Rantsylvania - We Really Do Suck."
We waited this long for this? A movie that not only does not make a heap of sense but is a major let down in the most profound sense of the word. Its seems to me that the Wachowski Brothers only concentrated on the special effects but forgot about writing a compelling plot to go with it. The mythology that made the first Matrix such a classic is thrown out for an incoherent cyber juke of a story that not only insults the legion of fans but makes them look stupid for waiting around for theses sequels.The Wachowski Brothers should be a shame of themselves for ripping off the fans of the first movie.
"Yes, this carafe holds coffee, and does a superb job. But it can also store tea, hot water, soup, hot chocolate, marbles, you name it!I've purchased two of these now. My first one broke (it stopped keeping coffee hot), and the second one is for my wife. She likes to drink that crappy flavored coffee, and I don't want it tainting my Italian roast Colombian experience."
"Arrived broken, I should have listened to the advise given about the shipping. However, in all fairness, Amazon was quick to allow me to return, and just as quick as crediting our account."
"My 18 month old boy normally has a very short attention span (sound familiar?!), but this kitchen/grill set keeps him actively engaged for quite a while! He loves making me a cup of coffee or grilling a burger for dad.My husband and I put this toy together in about 30-45 minutes. I'm sure it would have been harder with only one person. The instructions say not to use a drill, but we did and it was no problem -- much easier/faster!All of our doors fit fine, maybe we just got lucky? I agree more noises would have been nice, but that's what there imagination is for, right?!I definitely recommend this toy!"
Local stores do not carry white colored wire. Red and black are used for auto wiring and are easily found. You need white to properly wire an RV. Amazon is an easy source for this wire.
"After all the fuss about this book I could not wait to get my hands on it. Throughout my reading, however, I could not wait for Mr. Franzen to get to the point. In the end it was an uninteresting tale about a dysfunctional family."
"I was sorely disappointed upon receiving this product,as i was expecting the 1988 BBC documentary called ROCK OF AGES that you can find on youtube......The front cover looked from that era and being reasonably inexpensive,i just assumed that it must be one in the same.ALL this dvd is,is a collection of videos ANY def leppard fan has seen a jillion times.BUMMER"
"I bought the 40 ounce version on Ebay with free shipping for $28.00. I was expecting MUCH more for the high price. The Kleen kanteen is NOT insulated at all. If you put something cold in it, expect it to get warm really fast. If you put hot stuff in it (like me), expect it to get cold fast. Expect to burn your fingers every time you pick it up. Expect to burn your inner lip on hot metal ever time you take a sip. The steel is VERY thin. I expect that if i dropped it, it would certainly dent.This product is honestly worth about 6-8 dollars. If I bought it from their website for $28 AND paid the high shipping cost, I'd be enraged when the product arrived. It's simply way too expensive."
"Ordered this to help get contacts OUT of my eyes. I don't have trouble getting them in, so I haven't used the insertion tool. The little ""tweezers"" are great at picking out the contact after I've slid it down to the outside corner of my eye. Little case is very handy to fit in purse, cosmetic bag, etc."
"LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY FOR JUSTIN'S SOPHMORE ALBUM. MY FAVES ARE #7 AND #12."
"I must admit I was surprised when I received this cover. The package for this is about 1"" thick and it weighs about a pound. The vinyl is extremely thin and actually tore as I was putting it on. The vinyl is very cheap and you can practically see right through it. I previously had a similar cover and it was thick, lined, padded, etc. This is a single thin sheet of vinyl like a cheap outdoor tablecloth."
"Just FYI: This review is for the 2nd Edition boxed set, not the D&D3; hardcover.There is much to the old axiom of 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it', and as cliche as it might be, it holds very true to the 2nd Edition Forgotten Realms boxed set. Oversized text and space wasting boarder art notwithstanding, the 2nd Ed boxed set incorporates all of the nonsense of the 'Time of Troubles' trilogy of novels. It also adjusts the Dale Reckoning time line by almost a hundred years for no reason. It gives scant overviews of too large of an area, and almost nothing on the things that really matter, like characters, noble houses, and rivalries between states. It also brings out the worst of the Realms, like munchkin characters such as Drizzt Du'Urden and Elminster. Stick with the grey 1st Edition Boxed Set, it's a much superior version."
"I will admit upfront that I have not read nor will I read this book. But let me say this about R.C. Sproul.He's a smart man with a good deal of natural intelligence but in many ways he has wasted his life by supporting a dying cause - Calvinism.The Reformed and Presbyterian denominations in the U.S. are dying, and indeed are on their deathbed, and all of Sproul's intelligence cannot nor will it change the reality of this dying heresy.Calvin was wrong from the beginning and Sproul was wrong to take his God-given mind and use it to try to prop up Calvinism.I will say again, Calvin was wrong from the start. The Holy Spirit is nowhere present in the writings of Calvin anymore than He is present in the writings of Sproul because the Holy Spirit is not the Spirit of division and untruth.What a terrible waste, but this is what happens when your father in the faith is not Jesus Christ but John Calvin."
"This thing, as a polite term, is cheap and poorly made. If you do not intend to sit in it but rather, use it as a visual piece for selling a house, this may be for you. Otherwise, save your hard earned money! Shortly after using it a weld cracked. I am not huge or hold elephants in my lap. This left the chair unstable and made impossible to drink coffee while seated.Regarding the weld failure, I understand that stuff from china needs help. I paid to have that repaired at a machine shop. The welder said it was just soft steel. In my opinion, this is a short term product and is produced to be sold. Repeat customers? That's a laugh. Without reservation I can say that I wouldn't buy another mac product; ever. Almost omitted this....whatever cushioning the seat provided when new soon evaporated. No kidding, it's a joke (on consumers)!"
Easy to use.It is not accurate but close.It also gives the hear rate along with blood pressure reading.
"There you have it. It's fun if you are playing it and your kids will love it. But you will want to smash it against the wall after a while. It is EXTREMELY annoying to listed to when the kids are playing it.If you send it with your kid to the neighbors house, you no doubt will be asked to come pick up your kids and their Bop It!"
"There is nothing new in this book. It was written to ""preach to the choir"", to cement pre-existing opinion rather than to present evidence and change minds. Researched with a ""have a theory, we'll find facts to support this theory"" rather then any real scientific method. Claims that God's marriage plan of one man, one woman was set in stone from the beginning of time, yet ignores that polygamy and use of concubines was God's rule of the day in the Old Testament. Even if it were not poorly written, the thought process investing in this book is lacking."
"I am a big Krall fan, but this album lacked that special touch she has had on past albums. A little bit to much orchestra, and not enough piano. An okay album, but not great."
"If the show has Reed Timmer & Joel Taylor in it, you are sure going to expect an action packed show. Unfortunately, Tornado Glory falls very short of thrilling TV. Save your money & watch the TV series ""Storm Chasers"". You will get much more out of watching the series than this cheap attempt of a DVD."
"Don't buy this CD, I listened to it and it's wack. Snoop is trying so hard to be a thug, but it doesn't come through. The production is wack and his flows are tired. Give up snoop. ..."
"cuts real clean some other blades i bought before didn't cut real clean and smooth these blades do , grip feels nice too better than bamboo"
"This is a great product, especially for the price. I use them regularly, some wind does get through, but not enough to make the ride uncomfortable. Highly recommended."
"I had high hopes for this mystery, but it was very choppy, and the writing just wasn't very good. I couldn't recommend it."
This is a great show! The story line keeps you coming back each week.Darryl is one of my favorite characters and you just never know who will get attacked next or be off the show.
"I couldn't even get through half of this poorly-written book. It was as though the authors were trying way too hard to think of catchy descriptive words to fit in ad nauseum. I thought it would be ""hilarious"", but I didn't find it funny in the slightest, in fact it was very boring and empty. It didn't hold my attention, the characters were one dimensional and the writing was oh, so completely bad!I found myself thinking after turning virtually every page, ""what a waste of time this is"". I finally tossed it into my garage sale box after forcing myself to read almost 1/2 of the book. The popularity of this mindless piece (rather than the subject) makes me worry about the state of society!"
"I thought this CD needed a review from someone who had never heard The Used before and wasn't comparing it to their previous albums. That would be me.The weak tracks on this album are the slower ones, ""Find a Way"" and ""Smother Me."" A few of the other tracks may be a bit poppy for some tastes (""With Me Tonight"" springs to mind), but they're musically solid.I have to agree it sounds a little overproduced, but I still enjoy it immensely and listen to it nearly every day. ""Pretty Handsome Awkward"" is particularly good when you're stuck in traffic!"
"Too basic and not specific to the topic. Too general. It seems the author took a template and pluged in ""nusring home business"" where necessary."
"This book was great! It explained more types of adoption than I knew existed, even after having read some other adoption books. This book did a better job of describing all the types of adoption and more than a dozen subtypes. I thought the strategies in the book to adopt quickly and beat the odds were really clever. I liked the casual and easy manner the author explains the information. The author sounded very caring and ethical. I felt like he was just talking to me and explaining everything in a way that made complete sense to me. I found the summary of each state's laws in the back of the book and the biographies of adoption attorneys in each state really interesting and helpful."
The product worked perfectly for the purpose it was made. I had occasion to use it almost immediately and its accuracy was verifiable. Good product and useful to have. Stays in the glove box.
"This book is an eloquently written, serious, and original set of lectures. The book will interest political scientists as much as historians or just simple readers ( as myself) because of its explicit orientation to "" International history"" . There is a highlight of very deep manipulation of the concepts of power, economy, and culture in order to explain why his three eras-late Meiji, interwar, and postwar differ from each other.Well, is not a simple analysis, and is without spelling errors , not as some reviews about it."
"Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. We bought this vacuum because it was inexpensive, and we're a family of 5 on one income. It's done a passable job, for the most part, but our filter is absolutely disgusting (we're also outside dumpers)and we cannot find one anywhere. We don't have the money to replace the vacuum, but we have an 8 month old who's crawling and we don't have a choice. It's too bad that you can't find a quality product for an affordable price anymore."
"I forget exactly what I paid for these headphones, but I'm pretty sure it was less the twenty bucks. The item showed up promptly, and it was just what I was looking for. A simple pair of headphones, comfortable, functional, and they sound great. If you don't need anything top of the line, and are looking for a good pair of headphones at a extremely fair price, these are for you."
"BUYER BEWARE: the model you'll receive is #3000000458 and NOT the model advertised. However Amazon's ASIN: B0009PUPX8 on my invoice matches the ""Product Details"". Thus, you will receive a much lesser BTU stove (14,000) and NOT the 21,000 BTU model advertised! LOOK CLOSE because they look identical, but differ greatly on their BTU output!"
"After reading wonderful books like, ""What Alice Forgot"" and ""One Day"" this summer it is with much regret that I wasted my time on this vapid, predictable book. The dialog alone made me roll my eyes on several occasions. I beg you...don't waste your time or money on this one."
"This was a book that was not in the condition as advertised. It had ink marks on the edges of the pages and the pages were trade copy quality instead of tight and smooth. I specifically chose this seller for the description they gave of the condition of the book, as it was for a gift. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
"Ever since I watched an episode on the History Channel about books that were not included in the Bible, I have been interested in what might be in those books. I checked this book out of our local library, but found that I wanted my own copy as a reference. It has met my expectations and is a good addition to my personal library."
"This is by far our favorite animated video for kids. Johnny Cash doing Bling-Blang? What more need be said. Oh, well I guess I should point out that the animated treatments are all strokes of pure genius. That might be nice to know.Somebody, anybody release these animations in DVD format, so we don't have to resort to copying to digital."
"It didn't seem possible that the Swiffer Wet Jet could work as well as the commercials. It doesn't. It's useful, though. Although I use the Swiffer Max, Swiffer Wet, and the Swiffer Wet Jet, I still find it necessary to use the dutch broom and the sponge mop every week or so to get the floor really clean."
"This movie was release many years before Pope John Paul II, but looks very similar to the life of Pope JP II. Great movie to watch in family. Anthony Quinn is superb, fantastic. You need to have in you collection. Now in DVD is better."
"This book was given to my by a friend,along with several other books by this author. And i have to say that i was blown away! This has to be one of the most intense books i have ever read. And if someone doesn't pick up the movie rights to this book, I may have to take up a collection and do it myself."
It was a great buy. Just what I wanted. The setup and installation was simple and concise. The baby loves it!
I am a huge fan of catchy melodic girl rock/pop. If you enjoy this album then I strongly recommend that you check out the following:1) Jalopy Go Far by Zolof The Rock and Roll Destroyer2) Ready 2 Pop by Miss Mary3) An Illustrated History by Puffyamiyumi
"I got the email recommendation and got really excited to click ""buy"" but thank GOD for customer reviews! I can't believe for as cheap as technology is and how many people have been waiting for this show to come to DVD with ALL MUSIC AND JOKES INTACT. That money couldn't be spent on music royalties. If price is an issue, RAISE IT! I for one would be glad to pay up to $45 a season if I could get it all and I'm sure I'm not alone. For now I'll keep watching my bootlegged DVD's that I paid $150 for all the seasons with all the memories. But it sure would be nice to have a nice, pretty, clean studio release to enjoy. I will gladly spend the money if you just pay the royalties and give us what we want."
"I bought one of these for my cat because she would never come in from outside when I called her. I would click it before feeding her, as I put her bowl down, and then 1-2 more times while she ate. I did it for a few weeks, then I clicked it while she was inside to call her for her dinner.Now if I'm calling her from outside and she doesn't come, I'll grab the clicker and she comes running right to me. I feed her as soon as she comes home and click it again while she eats.It went through the washer/dryer once, and is still working fine."
"While not my favorite Pat Metheny selections, certainly this vid will be much appreciated by Metheny afficianados. watching how he makes his music is revealing, to see the facial expressions as his fingers work their magic, especially how his mouth moves - as if the sounds coming from his instrument were in reality coming from his very soul - grin - which of course, they are. A culmination of much of the life long theme that characterizes his work, which any Pat Metheny fan will instantly recognize, this piece is the pure essence of the Man who is surely the Mozart of our age.Jonathan R. Zylstra"
It is an ok product. A bit cheap feeling and also it wasn't advertized for which psp system it belongs (I got the wrong one although I should have checked so it's my own fault). Nice packaging though.
"I don't think I'll ever hit off another tee. Eight rounds in four days and I never broke a tee. The color even makes them hard to lose off the tee! (I think I managed to forget a couple I used to mark a ball in the fairway during a scramble.)No more searching for broken tees to use with irons off the par 3s. I just used an unbreakable tee and slashed away. The price is rediculously low for the experience provided. I could have used the same tee on every hole, if I hadn't loaned a few to partners!"
"This type of humidifier works ultrasonically, which is very quiet and puts out a lot of moisture. The vibrating membrane that creates the mist does get clogged over time with minerals if you have hard water. It can be cleaned to a point, but eventually it might stop misting. You will find a fine layer of sticky mineral gunk all over the room (on any exposed surface), unless you have soft water. There are additives you can put in the water to minimize this. Small rooms may get too humid unless it's on the lowest setting. We have been pleased with this one so far."
.....If you don't mind literary licence this is a pretty good story of the Abolitionists and the pro-slavery forces that led to the Civil War. Raymond Masey gives a dynamic performance as the fanatical John Brown who wanted to free the slaves by inciting them to revolt......The movie also pairs Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland for one of their many appearance together with the lovely miss DeHavilland as the love interest of both Flynn and Ronald Reagan with Flynn emerging victorious......Altogether it is an enjoyable film that combines history with fiction and a love story thrown in for good measure.
I was told this book was full of ideas and I found it was more about hope and learning. Yes there is so much information in the little book to understand and grasp. I didn't realize it is based on both partners wanting to reconcile. But even still I learned a lot and plan to read it again very soon. This time maybe grab a few things I skipped or missed befor.
"I agree with the person who tried this diet for 7 weeks, lost 5 lbs. the first week, then nothing else happened. That's exactly what happened to me! I started on January 18th (nine weeks ago) and I finally quit in disgust a few days ago. What WAS true is that you lose your food cravings during the day (I stuck to protein and vegetables/salad during breakfast and lunch.) What is NOT TRUE is that your daily reward meal (usually at dinner) will enable you to lose weight. In other words, my food craving stopped, but I didn't lose weight! As a matter of fact, I started gaining weight in weeks two, three and four before again reversing. I agree in principle with everything said in this book (including the need to regulate insulin/blood sugar.) And if your goal is WEIGHT MAINTENANCE while eating anything you want (including pizza, chocolate, ice cream, and pasta) on a daily basis, then this book is for you. But you will NEVER NEVER NEVER lose weight with this."
"Good light reading. The antithesis to the Hornblower character. Entertaining, and fun to read, probably accurate in terms of 18th century seamanship."
"Bone-shaking, soul-piercing flamenco-blues and flamenco-jazz. The musicians are phenomenally talented and innovative. This is a classic album that transcends genre."
Good book to help save lawyer costs and to help understand the probate process. CD was a great help in writting a will.
"I don't like this book for following reasons:- The source code can't be used on a project due to bugs and poor quality.- The author does not know what Java Beans are but goes on to provide a buggy utility class.- About 30% of the book is dedicated to non XML related concepts such as EJBs and Servelts etc.,- Does not explain the concepts of DOM L1/L2 in detail.- Does not describe JAXP in sufficient detail.There are few more reasons, but I will stop here due to lack of time...The landscape of Java & XML is very dynamic. There are lots of good books on XML but there are no good ones that provide good conent in the context of Java and JAXP. There is no point in buying this book unless company is paying for it."
"I bought this book on a Sunday while I was in basic training for the USAF. I really got me through some of the tougher days, and I treasure this book to this day- I have pages marked and certain sections highlighted. I love this book!"
"This is a great guide to the abandoned mining towns littering the outback of Nevada andCalifornia. There's more towns dead than alive out there! Modern cities and highways are shownin black ink, and the ghost towns and historic places in red, complete with anecdotesdocumenting their significance and the years they existed. Useful in combination with Delorme'sNevada and California atlases (which you might need to actually find these towns, given the small scale of the ghost town maps)."
"Tim Burton does it again like always. I love this movie ever since the first time I saw it when I was a kid. Tim Burton is a genious; Edward Scissor Hands, The Corpse Bride and the remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory if u love any of these films you'll love the Nightmare Before Christmas. If u don't then well you're a lost cause."
would buy another. Works to charge ps3 controller and droid razr at the same time while playing them both. so you should buy it too.
"My 4 year old got this for Christmas. Well made and it comes with a sheet of paper to show how the whole thing looks when put together, and the names of the Dino's on the puzzle."
"This stuff is not total BS, but I would be hard pressed to give any novel so aestetically displeasing as this anything more than a 7, even with some great passages. The characters are one dimensional, the philosophy is half baked, and the plot is does not exist. A slow plot would be OK, if the characters were capable of some Joycean epiphany, but epiphany is made impossible by the philosophy"
"""Shane"" is deservedly known as one of the great Westerns.""Shane"" is the story of a gunfighter who comes to the aid of a family of settlers who are being persecuted by free-rangers. There a many allusions to Christ in the character of Shane - his sensitivity, his serenity, his humbleness, his restraint, his self-sacrifice, even the fact he is only ever referred to by one name.Shane is perfectly played by Alan Ladd matched by Brandon de Wilde as the young boy Joey who idolizes Shane, and Jack Palance is appropriately sinister as the ""bad guy"".""Shane"" is superbly staged and shot with great use of foreground and background shot compositions particularly in the bar-room sequences - and who can forget the final sequence. This film more that any other mythologizes the Western. A stunning achievement by director George Stevens."
this a great buy i highly recommend this purchase. had a funky smell on the inside but that was from the stuff they used to fill it but i washed it in the sink and the smell inst as bad.
"This is one of the best Ninja books I've read! Kirtland Peterson describes in depth why the public still views ninjas as violent, deadly, assassins. He describes other various ninja stereotypes. There is a lot of ninja history in this book. Kirtland refers to Masaaki Hatsumi, Stephen K. Hayes, Jack E. Hoban, Bud Malmstrom, Glenn J. Morris, and Christopher Hunter/Ashida Kim. Stephen Hayes does a excellent foreword in this book. I won't spoil the rest of book for you. If you like this book, I suggest reading anything by Masaaki Hatsumi, Stephen K. Hayes, Jack E. Hoban, Doron Navon, Glenn J. Morris, Charles Daniels, Bud Malmstrom and Richard Van Donk"
"sounds like a thousand outher garage funk bands out there ,lead singer very annoying ,bad mix on the recording not that impressed sorry"
"I got this as a christmas present this year, I used it for 2 days just for toasting bagles and bread, it worked fine, it seemed to take longer than the preivous oven I had. I was trying out the broiler on some fish, I had it on for no more than 2 minutes when the glass door exploded, the glass went everywhere, ruined my lunch. I called the customer service number and they are going to send me a new one, but I am not so sure that I want it now b/c I read a similar review. This item needs to be recalled. It could really hurt someone!"
"This was a good romance story. Lilith, a widow sponsoring her nieces first year in London. Julian's cousin is crazy about Lilith's niece, Ceicly. The story starts with Lilith accepting another's marriage proposal. Julian's cousin's mistress makes a deal with Julian, if he seduces Lilith in 8 weeks she will return the letters his cousin wrote her and release her hold on him. Everyone in Julian's family thinks the cousin is going to marry his mistress. This is a great seduction, where Julian is as much seduced as Lilith. Not original storyline but was still good."
"I thought that this book would teach me the basics of MySQL in a relatively short time. While I did learn some things, I spent most of my time figuring out how the author got from one step to the next. There were numerous typos in the code that left me, as a beginner, scratching my head. Most SAMS books are great, but not this one."
The Book was exactly as described. It arrived when expected and in good condition.Good Job
"This Belkin 7-Port Hub is quirky --- sometines failing to recognize and/or handle certain devices. Since these same devices work fine with the Belkin 4-Port Hub, I'm rather disappointed."
"I wish we had a NEGATIVE STARS choice because this deserves -5! It's horrible, it's a Christian Fundamentalist view using two poor schmucks to push it. I had to read it when I saw my enemy Ann Coulter loved it, I knew it was going to be an unfair and unbalanced look. I was not disappointed!"
"I bought this DVD based on a marketing email from Amazon. I was hoping it was from the amazing tour that just ended. What a mistake!! I truly feel ripped off. Ancient, grainy concert footage (most of it featuring the Dave Navarro version of RHCP). No actual complete performance of even one song. Really inane commentary from annoying british rock music critics. It all adds up to an experience that will suck the life out of you. Stay away!! If you don't have ""Live at Slane Castle,"" get that instead. You'll thank me..."
"OK I understand everyone's point of view in thier comparisons between the stage production and the movie. I've heard both soundtracks. Personally I prefer the newer one because I can relate to it. Music was never about what notes a person can hit or how well trained they are. It is about the emotion it inspires. I don't feel as much in the original cast production. It just seems more realistic that the Phantom should sound more seductive to express why Christine would be torn between him and pretty boy. I really enjoyed Gerry's singng because when he sang I knew how he felt. That's the point isn't it?I prefered Emmy as well. Sarah had a tendency to make the words less understandable in order to make her training more evident.I went and saw the movie almost a week ago and still have the music there, inside my mind.I definitly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the story and thinks the Phantom should be dark and more mysterious than he was portrayed prevoiusly."
"I got this splitter so I can watch movies on my Xbox 360 using netflix, while I am doing my college homework on my laptop and this thing doesn't even work. Only Jack 1 worked on the splitter and Jack 2 is faulty and doesn't even work... this is a poor product and i wouldn't suggest getting this!"
"I have now bought these bibs repeatedly for my own children, as well as gifts for several others. They are by far, the BEST BIBS EVER! They are soft & thin & comfortable for the kiddos to wear, yet waterproof & protect their cute little clothes. The velcro is secure but easy to use. I love the pockets, as they catch a lot of the mess & end up protecting little laps as well(& my kids have learned to eat ""seconds"" out of the pocket). They are so easy wash or rinse & they dry very quickly. I usually use one bib per day-rinse between meals/snacks & hang dry-then the bib is dry & ready for the next meal or snack. Perhaps a bit more pricey than some bibs, but worth every penny! You will NOT regret this purchase!"
Good movie and features but the trailer wasn't the one I'd seen in many times in the theater. Ah well.
"I searched forever for a good seat for our daughter. I came to this one through reveiews, and I am so glad I got it. It is so easy to put in and switch from our two cars and it fits in my husbands Civic, which I was very glad it did. It is so soft and our daughter loves it. She know can see out the window at what's going on around her. And unlike her baby car seat this one does not move when it is strapped in, which makes me feel SO safe. I don't know how I lived without it. And knowing how well it did with front and side impact ratings is a MAJOR plus. Very glad we have it."
"Let's face it. It doesn't take all that much to rewrite archetypal fairy tales. What takes talent is making something whole and new up out of the depths of the imagination. I find this trilogy sorely lacking on both points, the rewrite and the ""new"" aspects of the story.I guess the threshold is very low. Sorry, can't recommend it. It's pretty on the cover, but the writing is stiff and not all that original."
"Donovan meets James Brown and Brian Eno at the Apollo Theater. No, wait, aren't we in Satsang? Man, this is the craziest, most boppin, foot tappin Bajan R&B you will ever hear. Go for it."
This video brought back some incredible memories of my youth. Motley shenanigans are priceless and their music rocks. This video is a time capsule that is worth the few dollars I paid for it.
Cans are always getting stuck and the handle is always falling down in the way.I would return them if I wasn't so lazy...
This book is a complete waste of money. I bought it last year before going up to Hong Kong. It is very outdated and not at all helpful.
"I too wasn't very impressed with Jarhead. I thought half way through that Jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the Marines, and perhaps other branches of the military. For those of us who haven't I just don't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested. As someone else mentione. I too thought it was going to be a more modern version of Full Metal Jacket, but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't..."
"This book has no originality. I mean, it's about a kid with dragons. Oooooo. Am I supposed to be impressed.Not to mention:1. The writing is bad.2. The story is predictable.3. Eragon is a stupid name, derivative of Aragorn.You ask me, the best dragons book out there right now is Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate, written by the youngest sci fi novelist in the world."
"The concept was so good that I ignored the negative reviews and I just had to try it myself.I successfully used the unit once! Unfortunately after I washed the probe it stopped working. Just like the other reviews, it started showing abnormally high readings. My other probe thermometers survive my washing and handling of them.Other nits, setting a temperature is really cumbersome, it only goes up so if you missed your setting you have to do another lap."
I dont think this was a vary good game at all.I saw it on the shelf at toys R us and thought it whould be a fun game for my 5 year old.Wean i got home he beat it in about 20 minuits i whatched him play it thare wasent that much to do in it expect bulid a rocket avoid swiper drive a car and fly to the purple planet.After the game my son was vary upset so we went back after lunch and we saw a game called sonic the hedgehog it was alot more callengeing for him and it didnt take about 3 minuits to load like the other one did we also got are 30$ back wean we returend it.We have had to other dora games that wernt so good ether I think that Nick.Jr jest wants your money on these sort games that get you so upset.I think you should choose something else besides this
"Everything about this movie is cliche.2 dimensional characters, laughable security at a supermax facility and predictable story line.Do yourself a favor and skip this."
"very poorly compiled set. The set includes magnets for the back of the dresses but how do the dresses attach to the dolls? No clue! No directions were included. We got it in the mail and the pink ""closet"" box was p[packaged inside a brown cardboard box with nothing else in it. No pictures of the princesses on the outside, no directions NOTHING. What are the cardboard names of the Princesses for? No instructions for that either. In our opinion for 40.00 + shipping you should be given more instructions. What a waste of money, my 7 year old on Christmas morning is disappointed and has no desire to play with this because we don't have a clue how to use it!! Do not waste your 40.00. there are nicer paper dolls out there that don't need instructions to play with."
"Let the reviews tell the story, this album is, in my opinion, one of the best albums this year. Disturbed has changed their sound a little with this album and all the of the songs are completely power-packed. Stricken is a very nice single and it has Disturbed written all over it. Guarded is also very good it has in your face sound right from the get-go. Enough said. Go out and buy this album, you are wasting precious time reading these reviews."
"A must for those who are familiar with Luria's works, Assessment of Cognitive Processes is a wonderful book, explaining the best intelligence theory to date: the PASS theory of intelligence. Focusing more on abilities and not in capacities or mere base of knowledge, the PASS stands for Planning, Attention, Simultaneous and Successive processes. I use a lot this theory in conceptualizing my cognitive and neurocognitive cases. The PASS Remedial Pogram (PREP) who stand for PASS Reading Enhancement Program is very useful for children with reading disorders, training them to develop Succesive and Simultaneous strategies. A wonderful addition to the field. If you are a cognitive psychologist or a school psychologist and do a lot of work with children this is the right book for and introduction to remedial instruction"
"I received the product on time, however the conditions was a bit surprising in that It was not as new as expected. The book makes easy and interesting reading. This is certainly a a book for all times, a personal collection, a masterpiece in terms of reshaping ones attitude, perspective etc relating to peoples behaviour, feelings etc. Product is highly recommended by me. A book for all middle and senior managers and persons who work in the public sphere."
I am 32 years old and still read this book. In the 90's Pikes book were like the Harry Potter back in England and the States. It has many turns and twists. Its could've made it into a movie. I want to read this book. I will keep reading till the the day that I die.
Part of the book is true.I have done a lot of research on this story.The same story was published 4 years before this was to of happened.Author has taken a folk tale and made a fortune by telling half truths.I am his great nephew.I have records to back this up.
"Nice while it worked but after using it a dozen times, the turbin started chafing against the housing and it stopped working: after opening, we concluded it was a very poor design."
"Good insight into the man behind so much good music.I grew up in Southern Ca and during the early 1980's I used to see Paul Williams often where we both had breakfast 2-3 mornings a week. It was called, The Old World Restaurant. On the corner of Sunset and Horn, right across the street from the original Spago. We alway said hello to one another and had idle chit-chat. He was very pleasant and was always alone. I remember what a big star he was in the previous decade and wondered what had happened to his success. After seeing the film I understand what happened.Glad to see he is back and still working."
"I thought this was one of the funniest Abbott & Costello DVD's I have ever seen!!! It has some of the funniest & most popular routines they do. If you like Abbott & Costello, you must get this!!!!!"
The router has a good network range. and the signal strength is strong. I have had no problems whatsoever using it till now. Except a minor glitch that it failed to install properly and i was not able to set-up a secure wi-fi network.
"The product shipped and received as described. Might not be worth $20.00, but is exactly what I wanted. I am using it for a photograph, not a document. Quality materials/wall mount/glass. Overall, pleased with the product."
"One of the important gifts I can give my children is to introduce them the Word of God. I brought this book for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it very much. ""Blessings Everyday"" is not just another devotional book. Each page gives hope that my child will grow to become a woman of God.There is another book that I happen to dicover as I browse Amazon.com is ""365 Prophetic Promises and Blessings for your Children"". I felt that this book would be useful for my 10 year old son and it is indeed a treasure found. I highly recommend both books."
the video is pretty tough but this is a gemrealise it is 1955 live tvit is a rare live performance of the great noel cowardand a great pairing with mary martinthis is a real charm to watcheven though the poor video qualityoverlook the video and enjoy the programits wonderful
"This book is divided, almost arbitrarily into four sections- Hook, Pitch, Clincher, Close. A major theme is selling, and so one comes to wonder what the book is trying to sell you on. Characters that are supposed to be endearingly innocent turn out to simply have no character development at all; a repetative and frustrating read."
"I'm about 1/3 of the way through this thing. I'd be done by now if it weren't for the incessant fashion descriptions favored by Ellis. These really get old after the first few pages. WHO CARES about Bateman's A. Testoni loafers? Get to the point! I suppose that I'll finish the book just to see what happens, but I can't recommend that anyone else waste time with it. In contrast to the reviews on the back cover, this book is neither important nor seminal.OK -- I finally finished it -- after which I threw it in the trash. (I couldn't even consider using the recycle bin.) This had nothing to do with the subject material -- it's just SO poorly written."
I love this CD I have wind chimes in my back yard and when I can I leave the window open. the wind chimes are very relaxing . So I decided to try a CD of wind chimes . I have a few. This is the best one. I listen to it with headphones and I never make it to the end of the CD before I fall asleep.Very relaxing
FoodSaver V2460 Advanced Design Vacuum Food SealerIt didn't work right out of the box. Why would you ship something that sounds like a frieght train running. Obviously a bad motor. Nice quality control.
"The bed looks pretty good and is higher then most. At first I loved it ,but have learned it requires air almost every night.I bought it as a permanent bed because of the comfort of an airbed versus standard mattresses.So I'm not too pleased with this particular product."
"This album is a huge departure from The Sea and Cake's previous album, Oui. On Oui, the songs were very warm, the synthesizers were used to support the traditional rock instruments. On One Bedroom, the songs, while still engaging, are more electronic and alien. The guitar steps aside for the synthesizer, and the drum machines seem to appear more than the drum set. The division between songs that center on more traditional rock arrangements and more electronic compositions is actually pretty equal. What's amazing is that the album is cohesive enough to make the instrumental songs flow seamlessly with the heavily electronic songs. Not only do the songs flow well on this album, the cover of David Bowie's ""Sound + Vision"" makes sense next to the original compositions. So, if you're interested in the Chicago music scene, if you like electronic music, or if you're a fan of tasteful light rock, go listen to this album now."
"I am a huge fan of the Floyd, they're my favorite band, but I had trouble dealing with Syd. I found his lyrics to be odd and tedious and lacking meaning. The album had no flow, the songs didn't blend, it had no direction. I actually found myself waiting for the album to end. Syd's singing lacks melody and his guitar playing is no match for Gilmours. This album was a valuable stepping stone, but nothing more."
"Like Flower Travellin Band, Tarkus comes from a land that doesnt seem like it would have made an impact, but the power of Zep and Sabbath hit the 4 corners of the world. Tarkus hailed from South America taking there name from the Elp album (though sounding nothing like them). It is a great record of proto metal/doom with a Zep/Sabbath feel. The singing is all in Spainish, which i only know a little, but it doesnt take away from the music. Its almost poppy at times..but the guitar work and sound is awesome Iommi-like. Only 8 songs clocking in at just over 30 minutes..its too bad they never had anything after this..i would have loved to seen where they would have taken it. Apparently there is still a version of this band sans the singer(who is in some religious cult) is still playing in South America..someone should record them too."
"does anyone know How long does the mobile stays on and the music? My daughter likes to hear noise so I am just curious if this is worth the buy? I know the graco is no good becuase it is battery operated, but the music stays on all night for her? Thanks"
"If you are looking for a topical discussion of technical and business writing, I think you can do better.That said, the book is a quick, informal, benign read. Though it purports to be updated, some of the essays go back to the early 60s.Some of the techniques discussed don't quite agree with the methods discussed in Mike Markel's ""Technical Communication"" or Carolyn Rude's ""Technical Editing.""If your instructor requires it for a course, buy it used. You'll likely sell it to someone else when you're done, as I will. It makes no sense to lose that much value on the resale."
We have been using this book in our Child Development Center for years. I love this book and bought one for my 6 month old Granddaughter (who is red headed like her mom) that lives in Haiti. (Missionaries)The illustrations are as pretty as the writing.
"I watched the movie for approc 3/4 of it and turned it off...to the news about our trillion dollar defcit and the blizzard in my part of the country and also some lunatic loose in California. Sad as all of those events are they were more interesting than this movie. Maybe if I were younger it might have seemed funny. However at age 56 I am known for my sense of humor. If there were a ""no star rating"" this movied would get it. I have Amazon Prime so I was able to watch it for free. If I had to pay for it I would recommend forgetting it."
"Extremely disappointing read. I had to struggle to finish the book. Unfortunatley, I bought this book because of it's advertising campaign. Huge displays at your local booksore with an add in the USA Today along with a headline that includes the words ""Jurassic Park!"", I was sucker punched. This book did not have one thrilling tense moment at all. Judging from the other reviews, I'm not alone. I only wish that I had taken heed to everyone's thoughts of wisdom. You've been warned. It's not worth the trip"
"it says digital copy, but you do NOT get an itunes code. you get an ultraviolet/flixster code. do you really want to deal with an entirely new and separate movie app, player, drm system etc??? i didn't think so. nuff said."
"I can't believe it took 7 years for this. All I Need is the best song on the CD but its all downhill after that. Not sure who this album is supposed to appeal to, and by the looks of its success and availability, I guess not to many. Most of you seem to like it so I am obviously the minority here. I am still a huge fan of songs he did with the Doobies (i.e. Nothing But a Heartache, Dedicate this Heart, Your Made that Way, Losin End, etc.) and I liked If That's What it Takes, but most songs on Blue Obssession are nothing more than Easy Listening music that's not so easy to listen to. The upbeat songs sound forced. On Build Upon It, which is a Takin' It to The Streets rip off, before the song even opens and sets a tone, its already in the chorus. If this was Michael's first album, I would never buy his second."
"There was lots of hype for this lousy event. There wasn't much good in this PPV. DEFINTELY do NOT buy this PPV DVD. I recommend buying Vengence instead. It was superior in every aspect, with much better wrestling and just a more entertaining show. This is the worst PPV of 2003......so far The Hell in the Cell match is even pathetic."
Suzanne Zuercher puts enneagram in the center of christian spirituality. She opens a new prespective and give the reader a sense of belonging and accepting our own personality. I love how benedictines teach the christian path.
"I have read and enjoyed all of Hoag's novels--until Kill the Messenger. The vulgur language and crude descriptions of characters really spoiled this book for me. I got through the first 100 pages, wincing and cringing as I read, and then took the book back. Tami, you can do it without all that vulgarity. It is really a turnoff!"
"I ordered this book because I too am an adult child of an alcoholic. The book is a collection of letters written by the author about her relationship with her father an alcoholic and her relationship with her mother the woman who married him. I don't know where you would find this book in a book store, it is not fiction, it is not a biography or a autobiography, and it certainly not a self help book. The subject of the book spiked my interest, the writing did not!!"
Quality brushed nickel finish; heavy-weighted handle works smoothly when used with the required Grohe pressure balancing valve....exactly as you would expect from a German product. Looks great. All solid metal components except for plastic mounting plate.
"This was the second RoadPro unit that I tried, as the first one came to me as a previous return from another customer. Now I know why it was returned....don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of junk! Although the temperature part of this unit seemed to work fine, I was never able to get a calibration on the compass. tried several times, tried replacement battery, tried different mount positions, IT WOULD NOT WORK! I ended up going ""old school"" with a mechanical ""bubble type"" compass."
"This is the second Sangean DT-180 AM/FM radio I have purchased. I needed to get a second one as my wife was always taking mine to use when she worked out. A great little radio that I use on my motorcycle, at work, and just out and about. Long battery life and it picks up the stations I listen to. Very happy with this radio. I suggest buying your own earphones. The ones with this radio are just odd."
"Format hard to follow, print is very, very small, hard to read. Did not find it helpful in planning my trip to Iceland. This book was not useful to me at all. Next time I purchase a travel book, I will select it from a bookstore. Some books are fine to purchase on-line, but not for something like this. I was hoping it would provide details on how to plan a trip to Iceland, tour guides or self guided."
"This Dragonfly Turquoise Gemstone ring is so pretty. I originally bought it as a gift for my sister but once I received it I liked it so much that I kept it for myself and gave her the butterfly ring I bought for myself instead. So, it made a beautiful gift to myself."
"It took only an hour or so of reading this bizarre story before I threw the book in my trash can. As a fan of Patricia Cornwell's, I've always looked forward to reading a new title, but this one is disappointing. Isle of Dogs might appeal to those who enjoy talking fish, conversations of crabs, dog's thoughts and computer skills, and seeing-eye mini-horses, but for that sort of thing I prefer Peter Rabbit, Uncle Wiggly, Winnie the Pooh, or science fiction."
I am 8 years old and I rented Jak3. I liked Ratchetand Clank Up Your Arsenal a lot more than Jak3. I thoughtJak3 was very hard and bad and it was not fun. I played for five days and I could not get past the first battle.You should definitely rent Jak3 before you buy it.
"Chris Farley plays the role of a clumsy ninja, ridiculous to the extent that I feel that it is an insult to ninjas. The movie is plain silly, not funny. This guy is worse than Jar-Jar Binks.Hard to imagine anybody could find this show funny.This is the worst comedy that I come across so far."
"This movie has beautiful acting and cinematography but it is difficult to pick up the various threads and make sense of them, particularly if you are unfamiliar with the Virginia Wolfe novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway"". The movie centers around three women, Virginia Wolfe, played by a hard-to-recognize Nicole Kidman; an unhappy young housewife from the 50's, played by Julianne Moore; and a modern-day woman played by Meryl Streep. Their stories interweave with one another and there are common themes of mental illness, lesbianism and unhappy women with death wishes. Not exactly light entertainment! There were times when I wanted to tell the main characters to snap out of it and get on with life rather than wallow in the melancholy and self-pity which they display. This is a movie designed more for art than for entertainment, so be forewarned."
"2 1/2Although hitting with a consistent adolescent angst showcasing the band's funk-metal skills and certainly hinting at promising things to come, without impending melodics they would develop next, Incubus's sophomore sounds little more than glorified local music dated to when biscuits were limp."
"This is a special interest movie, and there can only be lovers or haters of the same. So, let me acknowledge Woody's intelligence, and appreciate the many that worship this product. I cannot bear it, I always felt like slapping the guy. But then, if I react, even in this way, what more could the artist want from me? God, I give up, and I need some chips."
Sorry to say that I love the scales but it doesn't sevive the post office. With all the tossing around they do I have had two scales and niether one of them made it to me in working condition. If I could get it locally it would be a great product.Kathy
"I bought this camera to use while my husband is deployed. Not only is the picture terrific, but the in-line mike catches all the sounds in the house. Not only can he hear and see me, but he can hear our birds singing in the background, our nieces laughing, our teenage son leaving for work etc.. Great price and great quality, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a webcam. It waas super easy to install as well."
"This game is soooooo boring. It was a waist of money, they should have never made this game!"
This is a complete waste of money; the thing just does not work at all. The software is good but I could not get my computer to recognize the drive. The bottom line - buy something else
"The Washington Post reported that eight-six years after this scam first surfaced, a judge in Nov. 2006 in Iowa put the kibosh on the ""See Clearly Method,"" promoted in national ads claiming it could save consumers from having to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses. The court ordered Vision Improvement Technologies Inc. to stop all sales of ""natural vision improvement kits"" sold as the ""See Clearly Method"" as of Nov. 1, and to cease business altogether by Dec. 22. The Fairfield, Iowa, company, which shipped as many as 10,000 kits a month, at a cost to consumers of $350 a piece, was also required to pay $200,000 in restitution."
I love the contents of this magazine from cover to cover! The only reason why I'am giving it only 4 stars is because the copy I received has non acceptable damaged at the cover; but yet this may be the fault of either the company or the delivery agency... I'' get back with more info when the next copy arrives.
"I bought this item to replace another air cleaner that I was using. This unit didn't work correctly from the beginning. It would turn off by itself and wouldn't turn back on until you unplugged it and then hit the sleep button (pushing the ""on"" button had no effect). It was also EXTREMELY noisy even in ""low"" mode. I kept it in the very lowest setting as a result which meant it ceirculated very little air and was more or less useless.I lived with it for a few months. Now the timer on the screen indicates the filter needs to be cleaned. After I cleaned the filter, I followed the directions to reset the counter, but pushing the ""reset"" button doesn't return the screen to show 100% clean filter. After two days of trying the screen still flashes 0% and indicates the filter should be replaced.Now that the unit refuses to turn back on at all, so I guess it is going to the trash can."
"I found myself thinking ""why would they cast this lady as Jane Eyre"" she is not very attractive but as the movie went on I found myself really wanting her to come out on top so it must just work. I really enjoyed the actors and actresses it was great."
The book is very well written and entertaining even if you never played Fantasy Baseball. It's a nice contribution to the current debate between the traditional approach on baseball and the new SABRmetrics way of thinking the game
"This book is slow, seems half-written and I thought the ending terrible. After finishing the book I felt cheated. I don't think the characters were fully explored, the story was sometimes muddled and the end felt like it should have been the begining of the real story! I say pass on it and take something else to the beach to read."
You get what you paid for. The Silicone is a bit thinner than the expensive brands and you need to be slightly careful when you handle the cover since it can easily tear. But once its on the controller it does the job.
"A waste of Time. Sonic produces the most Blinkware software I have ever used, By that I mean it just blinks at you, and does nothing, sometimes it crashes. Sonic get out of the Software Business please, you give a bad name to Software. Only buy this product if you have extra time to spend"
"I really curious about this one: I love rage against the machine. But then... I started to listen to it...F***, it is Soundgarden stuff! Lyrics with no meaning at all, that super-solos of Morello just ripped apart and it's kind of a agressive-free music with the lighter-asking songs.I can't believe that Chris Cornell could just change a work of a lifetime, Rage Against the Machine is now a legend. Audioslave is just a regular band that would be a garage band if the elements weren't VIP's.Just buy Battle of L.A. if you want some real stuff."
"The waterject failed to operate after a few times (less than 10). The engine is dead, no water came out."
"I found this book rather sentimental and unsubtle, at least too much so for my taste. More importantly, I don't think this book is really for children. I don't think kids will relate to the father's emotion about his daughter, or simply may not perceive it: 'And he was smiling' may not be enough for kids. It doesn't help that the father is never depicted -- makes it harder still to identify with or understand this important character. And once the girl becomes a woman, I'm afraid that kids will feel very separate from her and so again not feel the deep emotion that many adults feel. This author has lots of fans, and many will enjoy the book no matter what, but in my opinion, as a children's book, it's flawed."
"The thin backboard cracked and began to bend on the first time out, and the support pieces were pulling away. Its all held together with cheap staples that pull out really easily.I took mine apart, replaced the thin wood with a piece of thick plywood, screwed everything together, and now Im happy. For all the trouble, I'd build my own next time, seeing as I had to rebuild this one and pay for it on top of it."
Buyer beware: I'm certain this is not olive oil. It is DEFINITELY NOT Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It has NO smell or taste of olive oil. I'm trying to get my $ back somehow . . . .
"Stephen puts it out there, and that just sums up where he's coming from to where he's at."
"I lived in Rio de Janeiro for some 5 years, teaching and coaching in both English and Portuguese .. this book was my suggested ""primer"" before arriving for the first time to understand the wild ""religion"" known as ""Umbanda"" or ""Macumba"" ... I saw most of the ceremonies noted in this book ""first hand"" in my 5 some years in Rio .. often at knifepoint .. often as the only ""white guy"" in the crowd ... it is stunningly realistic ... but returning to Rio many years later, these ""practices"" are all but disappearing .. anyways .. for me ... it is a ""travel back in time"" to when on Sunday when the 99% of the population would visit a Catholic Church, and then light their ""Macumba Candles"" on the way out ... ""just in case!"" Easy reading ... highly recommended if you have any interest in developing Brazilian society!"
"I have owned this nailer for about a year now, and it has definitely lived up to its expectations. I have trimmed out houses, cabinets, and various small projects with no problems at all. The quick release jamming mechanism is a great idea, but I've only had to use it once since I've had the nailer(this thing just won't jam up). It has good power but won't send the nail spiraling through the wood. Of course the swivel exhaust port comes in handy just remember to use it. The imprint the nailer leaves on the wood is virtually none except for the nail entry hole, much better than other finish nailers that I've seen. So to make a long story short if you want a good nailer buy Bostitch or Craftsman, but if you want a great nailer buy the Paslode."
Connected this cable to my TV and to a HDMI Sat. Receiver. Worked fine to begin with then the colors went crazy and stayed with the wrong color and bad image. Cable was well constructed but something caused problems. When things went funny the audio went off and would not come back on through that cable.
"My 3 year old daughter already has an adorable 2.5"" Strawberry Shortcake set with lots of pieces and lots of room for imaginary play. She loves it, but it only came with one doll. I've searched for the individual 2.5"" dolls but to no avail, so out of exasperation, I bought this set so that SS could have a friend. While the extra dolls were exactly what I was looking for, the rest of the set was a complete disappointment. There are only two pieces in addition to the dolls and their hats, and they are nothing more than kids meals toys. She was SO disappointed when none of the pieces came apart for play that she almost cried. I ended up taking the scooter and the cake off the platforms so that she could play with them and threw the rest away."
"This was a Christmas gift. We are very displeased with this set, almost returned it. The dinner and desert plates are Corelle Apricot Grove, the coffee mugs are STONEWARE and the bowls are Corelle, but of a totally different pattern. Yes, the product description does say that, but I'm used to searching for a product and getting an exact match. I could of, and SHOULD HAVE gone to WalMart and purchased itthere for $10 less."
"Both discs are damaged, possibly during the actual manufacturing or burning of the discs. There are large swirl-type patterns around the read faces of both discs that will not polish out with a micro fiber cloth. Therefore, parts of some of the episodes freeze up, and the discs skip to the next undamaged chapter, which is usually multiple chapters. Amazon does not replace these discs and they won't exchange the season for another title, because they are opened. I may try a buffing wheel, but I'm not sure it will help, as the marks don't appear to be scratches, but a defect in the discs themselves. I also bought Season 2 and 3 which are not damaged and play without incident."
I gave this to my brother for his birthday and we were all very excited about playing....but within one nights play we had repeat questions. Sometimes as many as four times! Anyone that bought this first version should be entitled to FREE updates
"I was so excited to finally find a piece by Torroba ""Twelve Interludes"" for guitar and string quartet that I never heard before but have been looking for for a long time. Unfortunatly, the performers totally massacre this work. They have sloppy playing through out and the recording is dead acoustically. What a disapointment."
I bought this game for my 4 and 6 year old and they love it!!! Many hours of fun. It does not seem to get old.
"Love her timeline (dropping night feeding around 8-12 weeks) and her forgiving spirit (if you've already missed that window, all is not lost, and you're not an idiot parent). I wish she'd be a little more explicit with her language sometimes. She rarely uses terms like 'cry it out,' but it is implied by statements like, 'let the baby work it out himself.' For someone not coming from a 'cry it out' approach, they might miss some of her helpful guidance because it is not direct enough."
"What a lump of coal...Written in a style that seems more interested in a company-centric style, this diatribe ode to corporate short sited bottom lines, takes a wishful thinking view on the wholesale and retail process of sending tens of thousands of jobs out of the country.The author gives brief lip service to the human tolls this process takes, always setting up a verbal best case scenario that includes more and better local jobs mystically appearing for the displaced workers this effects.Hey Tom, on the real world this process has led to double digit unemployment across the country. Take a reality check and pull your head out of your 5th point of contact.Congratulations to all the companies that have shaved a few points off the bottom line at the cost of their US former employees, and the long term well being of the country that sends out young men and women out to fight and die keeping you free."
"I wonder if Kevin Costner even realizes the artistic and historic contribution he has made with this film. As an artist I found this book to satisfy my graphic appetite and as a romantic I have, once again, been allowed to travel back in time. Mr. Costner has shown us his artistic brilliance in so many ways and I thank him for his efforts. Enjoy the book; it is a treasure."
"I bought this product mainly because I wanted my 3 year old labrador to stop loosing his hair, because he really looses a lot. It's not like he is sick or anything, it's just the normal on this kind of dogs. I read this oil could help diminish the hair loss, but I don't think it does that. So, I would recommend ask a veterinarian if this product is good for your pet and what is the purpose of taking it."
"I only use Aubrey hair products because all of their ingredients are truly safe enough to eat. My hair is thick, wavy/slightly curly, and tends to get frizzy. I use this conditioner at my gym because they use hard water and this one works best there. I've tried the other ""Dry Hair"" products and the Island Naturals and White Camellia left my hair too soft or oily and I didn't like the smell of the Desert Herb as much as I like the Honeysuckle Rose. I use the GPB conditioner at home because I have soft water there and the Honeysuckle Rose can make my hair too soft. A recommendation - if you have problems selecting a shampoo and conditioner, bear the water hardness in mind and try several, especially if you shampoo at more than one place. Thank you Aubrey for developing and producing such wonderful products!"
"I like Ralphie May , but I don't think this was one of his best, I have seen much better then this..I was not too happy with this"
"Pretty funny movie...if you like Seth Mcfarlane's humor. At least he didn't try to get all political. Unlike most of these types of theme comedy, it didn't get old by the first half hour. And oh yeah- Mila Kunis is a Russian Goddess!!"
"The package was correct but the disk was volume one,we already have vol. one.Can I send it back and get the one we ordered."
I really enjoyed this book. The only thing I would change is to move the historical information from the end of the book to the front of the book. I had no idea this novel was historical fiction until after I had finished reading it.I purchased extra copies to give to my baseball/softball playing grandchildren.
What a great little product! Bought it to take on vacation and I wowed my sisters with the sound. I have a Bose sound dock for home but wanted a portable dock. Could not believe such a tiny speaker system (fits in my tote bag) produced a very big sound. Well worth the money and am so glad I purchased it.
"Paulo Freire is one of the unsung heros in the field of education. Here he is again, writing such terse sentences that they have to be re-read several times to absorb all their nutrients. Just like his brilliant Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Education for Critical Consciousness is an antidote to the current U.S. crisis of ignorance and consumer-insanity."
This book will leave you examining what's important in life. I found myself wondering what our family would do in such a situation. It is humbling to think the Lord is in control of it all and we're to seek and do His will. There was a brief mention of 9/11/01. I felt it was tasteful and appropriate. It happened such a few short years ago and is part of our history. Let us not forget that tragedy while we let our mind wander and wonder: Could something really cause a power outage over the entire earth? How would we survive?
"Stories and acting of the highest caliber. Unlike most TV dramas today, it is difficult to anticipate/predict the outcome of these stories. Full of surprises and generally more realistic cold war spy thrillers than contemporary shows.The only reason for four stars instead of five is the disappointment that A&E; decided to show the British introduction instead of the Johnny Rivers ""Secret Agent Man"" song that opened the show for the US audience. It helped set the tone for the show. I guess A&E; thought the British audience was bigger than the US audience - hmmmm: I wonder what they use when they think."
"I love the album, especially wit my songs scandalous and the reggaeton latino remix. I cant stop playin it. gotta keep it up wit the reggaeton. don omar is a hit maker."
"This game is a really good game, except that homeruns are too common. Also, the scoring is high. Once, I was Detroit and the computer was Tampa Bay. The pitcher was Wilson Alvarez. In the 1st Inning I scored 28 runs. Also in the same inning 6 players hit homeruns all in a row. (I traded for some of these players) Ken Griffey Jr.,Sammy Sosa, Bob Higginson, Mark McQuire, Mike Piazza, and Deivi Cruz hit 1 run homeruns all in that order. In that game I won 98-1!! What was that about??? The graphics are great. In Homerun Derby I was Mike Piazza the computer Todd Helton. I scored 29 homers and Helton scored 0 homers.Another thing I hate is that I can CRUSH homers off of Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, but I can't CRUSH off of Mike Magante! It's crazy. Everything else is grreattt!!!!!"
"Most annoying piece of hardware that I have used.Pointer tracking,The most important of mouse's function, it does a worse job."
"It was a good book. A very quick read. It is something different from the book that are being but out to day. A kinder story, with love, not shooting and cheating."
"The most beautiful words ever said in a movie. Greatest actor in film directed by one of the greatest. de Niro manages to let us look deep into the soul of (insomniac vietnam-veteran) Travis. It has all the good ingredients for a really breathtaking classic. I watch it twice a year (except for the first year of course), and never get tired of it. Truly an extraordinary good movie."
"Poor mastering sums it up! Not a trade mark example of the Rush sound quality we have all come to know and love. CD companies need to be paying way more attention to sound quality details - especially considering what they expect us to pay for the final product. Furthermore, Rush themselves should be paying more attention and frankly I am surprised they let this one out the bag in the over modulated state that polutes all the exciting tracks. Digital technology isn't what's it cracked up to be folks. Don't let the CD companies get away with this BS - contact them and demand quality."
"The bird cage stand works as I hoped it would. The problem is that it has scratches all over it. Since each section of the stand was still wrapped in paper, when it arrived, I do not think this damage happened during shipping. Because the cage stand is so scratched up, I will not order from that place again; nor will I recommend them to anyone else."
"In this comeback of the Teen Titans, Starfire invites the teen sidekicks of the DC Universe to reform the teen-powered super team. As expected with teen sidekicks, they are all anxious to get out of the shadows of their mentors. Of course if the Teen Titans return, their nemesis Deathstroke will show up. In fact, the battle between the Teen Titans and Deathstroke is the highlight of this book as the young heroes pit their skills against the wily mercenary. Surprisingly, the Teen Titans also go up against the JLA! Since Wonder Girl joined the Titans without Wonder Woman's approval, Wonder Woman shows up to enforce her wishes. Of course it gets out of hand, and the two teams support their members. Teen Titans: A Kid's Game is a fun read, and is recommended to fans of the Teen Titans."
"If you were an adopted child, this was not a good experience. You go back through time, and it is the only chance you will have to see your mother. To turn away at the last minute, you have pined for this moment your entire childhood. The whole concept stinks!That bouncing around with very little plotline also stinks!"
"There's very little Brazil in these nights. Good musicianship but an enormous eagerness to sell, what is not bad per se but produces something that could be made by virtually any decent pop star around."
"After 30 minutes into the movie I was hoping Tom Hanks would starve or suffer from eating something poisonous. This movie didn't engage me at all. I had no respect for the main character. I did not feel connected at all. The tv-show Survivor had more drama in it !!Now for something that really bothered me : why the hell did he hold on to the last box for so long !! They could have saved the movie by having him open the box after coming back to the civilised world and having it contain a letter-bomb !!!Tom Hanks should be ashamed of himself. He played this role like he played most others. Just by loosing 30 pounds, doesn't make you a good actor, Mr. Hanks.If you want to see a good, spiritual Zemeckis film try Forrest Gump or Contact."
"I owned an Ipod video, its not worth the money!its battery life is poor, it has a small screen, the click wheel might be slick but cannot be worked out while running or with gloves, the user interface is annoying and the sound quality is not that high.when you switch to another player, like the sansa or better yet - zune - you will see ad hear the difference!"
"I give it 2 stars only because it was free. The illustrations are poor, and the 'poems' are pretty awful. it says on the back cover, in all caps,""WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND"" I think that's pretty creepy for a preschooler's book. Clearly this is a 'traditional' family values kind of book, and doesn't come across as being very accepting. In it's favor is that it is easy to read, and the concepts are very clear, though sometimes a little weird."
"I think these pads are actually a real pain to put on. I like the mop in theory, but I find myself avoiding cleaning the floor because getting the pad on the thing is such a frustration."
"This dictionary is everything you could ever wish, and yes, it is the very first. These very many and every original, clear Old English definitions is not that of today's complex excess baggage terms defined, but it even contains the sources of the many instances used. As a bible reader, I found and understood almost everything I looked for in my KJV bible, however the size is a bit bulky, but I got what I paid. 'One Look Search Dictionary' (http://www.onelook.com) has it free online, but it seems less complete. This book did not disappoint me."
This game is a classic and a work of art.These are the things that are awesome about this game (spoilers(?))- vultures- freaky giant spider- grues (you will defecate in your pants they are seriously scary)- cliff's comedy club- mine-cart ride- headache commercial on hotel room wall screen- the guy that shows up when you kill someone you're not supposed to
This review book for high school Biology is a great review resource filled with hundreds of practice questions. There are also loads of diagrams and charts that make studying the material much easier and less time consuming.
I love these crackers...to me they are the perfect blend of salty and sweet and go great with peanut butter! I am happy to find them on Amazon and not to have to drive 1.5 miles to an Asian market.
The amigo standard uke is a descent uke. It sounds great when it is in good tune. Not a bad uke probably a good choice for beginners. This was my first uke purchsed.
"I was very dissatisfied with this purchase because after I received the product, I found out that it was in a different language and I couldn't understand anything on the cd's."
"The story is overall a great book to read, but if you expect 10 people to read the book, I will bet that not all of them would read it willingly. I read it, but I know that I would not finish it if it hadn't for a grade or a requirement in school. The story have become more interesting from chapter 9 and on, but the chapters before that seems like it would take forever to read through it."
tried it on two computer. no luck. it kept freezing in the begining even before i got to do anything.
"Just received the item. It does nothing. the included mini CD just sits there. nothing happens. i get an error message 'windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. you may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.'is there any info on this item or did i just throw away $5?i use XP sp3 and am trying to play assassins creed with a PS2 controller.please let me know a page i can go to to try a driver for it. Heck, i dont even know what company makes this thing. there are no instructions or any info with it.got it quickly though."
"Do you like books that you absolutely cannot put down? Then Frindle by Andrew Clements is the book for you! This book is about a boy named Matt who has to do a homework assignment about how the words in a dictionary were made. While he is doing the report, he learns that words are just made up for no particular reason, so he makes up his own his own word instead of a pen he calls it a frindle. After a few weeks, the whole town is saying the word. I liked this book because it is funny and realistic. This book would be better for people under thirteen because I don't think people over thirteen will think it is funny. I say that because it will only take adults about 45min. to read this book. Since the kids will take longer to read the book they will understand it better. To really enjoy this book you have to read it slowly. I highly recommend this book for you."
I could not get the XM radio to modulate with my cars FM radio. I also have a Delphi XM radio and have had no problems. I followed the directions to the letter.
This is one great movie! Gary Cooper at his best! Dorothy McGuire is charming and Anthony Perkins before being type-cast as a psycho is superb!If you like James Stewart in Shenandoah then Friendly Persuasion is for you. Two great movies with similar themes.
"I remember back in the day when The Devil was my Holy Grail. I could not wait to get a copy and when I did I was completely thrilled. I still have that VHS copy and, you know what, the quality is better than the source transfer that was used to make this DVD.Apprehensive films should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a trash transfer. If you can not do something right, do not do it at all. You have lost yourselves a customer there Apprehensive."
"I should have paid attention to earlier reviews. I activated the subscription, set it to show any type of event and in 3 weeks driving routes around Chicago metro it has sat there. The icon says it is apparently active and yet it has not shown a single warning. It has set routes down freeways the same radio station says are stationary and NOTHING. Totally useless.Took it to LA, with the Traffic Kit as it does at least provide a good charging stand!!. Guess what it was picking up alerts and acting on them within 2 minutes although the traffic status display was identical to what I see in Chicago where it has never received anything."
"Everyone fell in love with this costume. It was nice and warm for the rain and snow we had that night. The only problem I had with it was that the huge collar never wanted to stay up, so people had to ask what he was. As soon as I held it up, they knew exactly what he was supposed to be. I tried ironing it, but it didn't help. I think it was just layed down too long the wrong way in the package. Other than that it was great. Most people loved how original it was for such a small age. My son looked majorly snazzy in it! I almost wish the cape could come off so he could just wear the suit around because he looked so cute in it!"
"The songs are fun, but there's just too much going on with instruments and making the songs more 'lyrical' to be sung with music instead of the good old fashioned camp style."
"I liked the way the book didn't get bogged down in too much math. The capital budgeting chapters were clear, much more to the point than the textbooks I tried to read."
"These are best suited for hanging as shown, rather than floors or flat surfaces (IMHO). Mine worked well in my tests and is a bit louder than some. Decent value for the price, I think. This design is a bit different than most others and well suited for hanging on a tub or basin (or whatever) to prevent overflow. Can also be used for leak detection, but the wire is very stiff, so in some situations the simpler, ""just sit it down on the floor"" designs are easier to use. But this is better if you need to feed the ""detector"" into an enclosed area or pan."
"I purchased the boots for myself, but my daughter wears them around the house all the time. They're like wearing slippers. They're that comfortable. So now, my daughter wants a pair."
"I started reading this with a completly open mind to a new writer and a new style, but I really just could not get into this book. It felt rushed, dry and a little messy.The plot was moving along so fast I could not keep up with it. The characters weren't introduced well and I didn't really feel anything for them. The romance did not seem real to me and the sex scenes were about as dry as the characters themselves. The story bounced around so much I really just could not get myself sucked into it.Overall I certainly did not care for this book, but in no way am I saying this to disrespect the writer. I have only the utmost respect for any author, no matter what I think about the book. And this in no way turns me off from reading one of her other books if one catches my eye."
"This is just another repackage of the Toronto 1969 concert which has been bootlegged and released without Alice's involvement under dozens of titles. Apparently, the ""Science Fiction"" title is an attempt to cash in on the other new release, Brutal Planet. Buy this if you're a completist and don't have it under one of the other titles.You'd think that by now, the record companies would have excised those two songs by the uncredited opening band..."
"This polarizer is horrible! It causes severe blurring on every camera I've tried it on. It matters not whether it's used with auto focus or manually focused this polarizer simply ruins your photos. I am at my wits end with this thing and I've experimented endlessly with this polarizer and can't for the life of me get a decent, clear shot. This shouldn't be called a polarizer it should be called a bluririzer. I guess it's true you get what you pay for, but keep the money you'd spend on this clunker an apply it to a better filter."
"I was surprised that this mystery-thriller was so well written. Nikki Hill has great promise as a continuing character, as do several others in the story. Interesting plot and the DA office setting could even be expanded.I'd like to know how much was written by Darden & how much by Lochte."
"The elegant writing and the well-paced daily life of the main character in this book make for a pleasant, rewarding reading. The descriptions of places and people are very nice.It's good to learn that Ron Ely, after gracing our TVs in Tarzan stories, produced a nice written work like this.I found the plot a bit weak, and it shows especially at the end. I would have given the book 3 and a half stars, if that was possible."
"I have followed Collegium for a while and was a little daunted with their recent trend for bringing out 'contemporary' composers. I now believe this to be a fantastic idea, having listened to this disc - what a DISCOVERY O'Regan is!Well done Collegium - I want to hear more!"
Eliza Dushku running through the woods in a shapely tank top. That alone is worth the purchase price. She is the only reason I bought Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.
"I totally love the album. ""Trigger happy jack"" and ""another world"" are the best songs. Poe's sound is differenent from Pj harevey, tori amos, and Fiona Apples, as they have been compared (i don't know why?). Poe as a really pretty voice, and plays piano very well. This is a very good album, everyone should own it. If only she could get more radio play...."
I don't know what the point of this book was. It took 102 pages to develop the so called 'mystery.' I knew I should have stopped reading but all the reviews had said what a good writer this author was. I stuck with it and now regret doing so. This is a very simple book with a lot of things that need to happen in a cetain way and of course they do. The characters seem to be living in the 1930's even though this takes place in current time. They all are naive people. This is my second book by this author and I will not make the mistake of reading a third book! You shouldn't either.
"He has got a unique sound, that makes you feel like you are on cloud 9. Makes you wanna tap your toe. So go out and buy ""The Ego Has Landed"", it will be a great addition to your CD collection!"
"I know that bike racks don't have instructions, but come on....we need at least some specifications....what bikes it fits, which ones it doesn't. BTW ladies, it does NOT fit a Small Giant Cypress!!! :( I liked it a lot though...on to bike rack #3"
"My daughter got this for her 2nd birthday. Within minutes, the cover of the drum was broken. She was not extra-rough with it. It is just very poorly-made. Surprising for Melissa & Doug."
"I've had an Olympus camera (1.3 MP, those were good ol' times), a Sony Cybershot (4.1 MP) and a Canon Powershot A520, but this one beats all of them and more.The screen is great, it takes great photos and the autofocus comes very handy (especially for us lazy guys who do not want to take manual pics).The only drawback this camera has, and this is a negative feature for all Canon cameras (Canon, can you hear me?), is that it doesn't show battery status but only when it is almost done with batteries. I guess you can live with that (I've had), but it would be nice to have a battery meter so I know what to expect."
"It looks a little like a medieval torture device, but the little cones on the underside of the lid allow moisture to drop back into the pan. Why doesn't everyone do this? Plus the lids has two little tabs that fit over the pour spouts of the pan - perfect! Nice tight fit. Great for anything that needs to stew for awhile."
"I am a lay person who reads a great deal of books about time and general/special relativity. Unfortunately, I was duped into buying this book by the reviews on the back of the book and the snazzy cover.However, the author simply rambles on and on and on, and never presents any scientific or mathematical proof that his theory is correct. This is quite simply the worst book on this subject that I have ever read. The ""End of Time"" has reinforced my position that I will never again buy another book in a bookstore without first having read the reviews on Amazon.com"
"I am such a big fan of Christine Feehan. Discovered her early and wait impatiently for each new book. I think her Dark series is sexy,taut,different and totally consuming. I enjoyed The Scarletti Curse almost as much. However, Lair of the Lion and now Shadow Game almost seem like they were written by somebody else.Again, this was a major disappointment!"
"Absolutely awful, a complete waste of money. I'm embarrassed that I spent my money on this. Please, I beg you to save your money."
"By bad, of course I mean good.These things are terrific. I've been using them a month. Can do 45 straight push ups already. I am seeing improvement in my upper body. The motion you get with these are wide-ranging. I also appreciate that the handles are thicker and studier than other similar push up grips. But these are in a class of their own. Get them and you'll be glad that you did."
"Once again, too bad zero ratings aren't allowed.This movie is just another piece of feminist propaganda from the late 1970s that regurgitates the usual anti-male spiel and has nothing of any substance to offer. The fact that the ""heroine"" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. She has her ""individuality"" and that's about it. George Harrison's song ""I Me Mine"" should have been playing in the background at that point.Blecch."
"Christopher Byron is a barely-contained little nut of rage whose transparent drive to make fun of or denigrate the powerful, seems his way of touching the hem of powerful, successful people. He appears to be in great need to vent his envy and impotence. Worthless read."
"This version of the movie on VHS is not recommended for collectors. The movie is colorized, apparently by a kindergartener with crayons. Blotches of pink and orange for faces and a torch which burns with green, orange, and yellow flames are evidence that the colorizing process was done in a haphazard manner with no concern for the quality of the job. The movie itself is quite good although I personnaly prefer the Richard Chamberlain version. 2 stars for a really bad print of a good movie."
"While I think it's fair to say that Orbital rarely disappoints, I find their latest effort excellent. Within minutes oflistening to the the first few tracks I was hooked. The Altogether will definitely be in my CD rotation for a while.From the perspective of Orbital's past works, I find this CD better than Middle of Knowhere and nearly on par (andsoon to supersede?) In Sides. If you've enjoyed Orbital's past work, then you should enjoy this CD. For those ofyou who don't like Orbital (which I believe is an acquired taste), you may begin to change your mind after hearingwhat they've done on The Altogether."
This purchase I made for my daughter as caillou is her favorite character and she like this very much. Worth buying...I recommend...
I bought the earrings for my daughter who adored them. They were small but bright and looked great. We went to view the floats the night before the Rose Parade and a couple of her friends commented on them. She loves them.
I use this instead of a diaperbag. It holds more and I can organize things better so I don't have to dig around for what I need. The only complaint is that it seems like the fabric JanSport uses doesn't seem as sturdy and thick as it used to be. We'll see how it holds up.
Overall I like this headphone and it serves it's purpose. The radio is pretty clear and the remote control is a neat feature. One bad thing is the cord from the the adapter to the remote control is too long. It is very hard to manage and gets tangle very easily.
"We bought this computer in 2005 and have had nothing but problems with it one after the other. We recently took it in to Best Buy (thank God we bought the extended warranty) because the screen was malfunctioning. I got a call today that this laptop has been recalled. That's funny, when I was on the phone with Toshiba support a few weeks ago they didn't mention the recall."
My six year old got this for christmas. He loves it. It has really helped him with his fine motor skills. Plus it is a lot of fun.
"Good story line and nice lesson for pre-schoolers! Can remind toddler of the situation, and how Little Foot and his friends handled it."
This film is so much fun I didnt want it to end. Amy Adams is transcendent in her role as the Princess to be Giselle. She shouldve gotten an Oscar for this performance. For me it is one of the most enjoyable and delightful performances Ive seen in a long time.I had to practically be forced to watch this film since it seemed on the surface like a kids film I didnt want to see. I was wrong. It is a film for everyone. It is funny and touching and has scary moments and great singing and dancing and its a beautiful film to behold in every way.I loved this film.
This Action Packed Movie Is Based On 3 Episodes Called 1. The Third Element 2. Buyer Beware 3. Stormy Weather This Is A Must SEE Movie Its A Great Video And It Comes Out On July 10.
"""Gnarl!"" is the companion volume to ""Seek!"" and probably one of the best story collections I've ever read. Featuring almost the entirety of Rucker's professional short-story output, ""Gnarl!"" includes hysterical and visionary pieces reminiscent of authors ranging from Kurt Vonnegut to Bruce Sterling (whose collaborative effort ""Big Jelly"" is featured here alongside gems co-written with Marc Laidlaw and Paul de Fillipo). As far as collections go, ""Gnarl!"" is becomingly introspective, and can be read as a transrealist autobiography. Rucker creates grim futures and funny scenarios that cover the spectrum of human emotion. Pac-Man addiction. Religious fervor. Microgravity sex. Beatniks and hydrogen bombs. Time warps and deranged aliens. ""Gnarl!'s"" got it all. You can't come away from the experience unmoved."
"I think these have got to be the best headphones for the money out there. I've had mine about a year and an super pleased with them. From great sound, great comfort, I am very happy. I mainly got them to use on flights where I was sick of the engine noise breaking in to the music. I had been using some over ear headphones, but needed something smaller. Much smaller. Enter these sony's.I will concur with one review I read below - the rubber that houses the wires broke down on my and exposed the wires. Annoying, for sure, but I'm just getting another pair. It took them a year and a half of daily use for this to happen, so I am not concerned."
"Been using this for many years now, still the best overallconditioner I have ever used. Leave it on for 10 minutes if youcan (per directions from years ago) for therapeutic results on hairand scalp. Only downside is it will take toll on coloring if you color your hair, so you may want to rotate usage with another of your favorites."
"I purchased it for a female friends birthday present! Needless to day it wasnt what I thought it would be! She wanted a Live performance of ""Kid Rock"". Instead she received a video of flashing tities & A MUSIC CD with unrecognizable songs. Now its sitting on MY bureau collecting dust."
"I purchased the book to satisfy my curiosity. I was not expecting to learn much since I've been investing for some time. I was wrong. Not only is the book crammed with useful information, but it is very easy to read with abundant graphics and humor.I recommend the book to all, both beginner and experienced investor."
"i thought this was a hilarious movie, Eddie Murphy plays Dr. Dolittle who discovers he has the ability to talk to animals.Hilarity ensues."
"I ordered these shoes to wear for capoeira street rodas, and they seemed great but they were too wide. I was able to give them to a friend that has wider feet and she thinks they're great. I was really disappointed that they didn't fit me. Although they look unisex, the width may be better for men."
Really funny if you don't mind encouraging your child in the direction of potty humor. better when read with an english accent.
"This is an excellent DVD. I love it because it teaches while girls can be little princesses, they can still do things for themselves. My little girl loves it and I highly recommend it!"
"When you listen to this album, it will transport you back to Andalucia (southern spain). I studied abroad in Seville over a year ago and this band had just made thier debut and Me ponga colorada was heard EVERYWHERE! The CD has a great blend of flamenco, pop music and moroccan flavor that you won't find on any other spanish CD. I cannot wait for their next album."
"I've never been a fan of Katzen's cookbooks. The original recipes were drenched in cheese, cream and butter. ""Ethnic"" recipes (except, perhaps, for those drawing on her own heritage) tended to be bland and inauthentic. Although the newer edition promises to correct these faults, I don't find that the food is substantially different. Bleah."
"Koontz always gets things going, and never lets go. This is the case here. The descriptions and not ""too"" far fictional characters often keep my pondering if this type of sick character could be real some day or present day."
"This book is an execellent tool to keep on hand, if you're a hosre owner. Its helpful for the time between the farrier appointments."
Half of the time your A STUPID TAXI DRIVER CARS ARE REALLY SLOW LIMITID WEAPONS LOAD TIMES ARE SLOW A WERY BAD GAME
You pour stuff in; and you pour it back out again.Then you clean it up for next time.And you get what you pay for.Perfectly good choice.
"If you haven't read any of these books to your children or grandchildren, you are missing something special. These are fun and adventurous ways to teach the alphabet."
"This is a piece of junk - the cars are supposed to hook together and be able to be dragged along by an 18 month old. The problem with this is, the cars don't LATCH together (they don't click into place) - they just set one car upon another. This means that when the child tries to pull the cars, he or she just ends up pulling the front car out, dumping the Winnie the Pooh character on the floor, and swinging the front car in the air. The ONLY way to get this to roll along on the floor is to pull the string along, parallel to the floor. The only child you could convince to do that would be older than 2, if not 3. And at that point, this toy is a little beneath them.Terrible, stupid design. I'm glad I got it as a gift, I would have hated to have spent any money on it."
"I purchased this item to help ease my daughter away from her finger-sucking habit. However, when the product came, there is NO safety seal on the outside box, and NO safety seal on the bottle cap. As a result, I'm afraid to use the product for fear of tampering or tainting. It's shocking to me that a product aimed for finger-suckers and nail-biters, and on the box states ""An effective deterrent for adults and CHILDREN"" has absolutely no safety seals to ensure the product can't be tainted or tampered with, in the long line of distribution from manufacturer to consumer!!! Very disappointed."
"I have returned this item TWICE. Their tray is not pulling out, so you have to -suck- out the water from it. It doesn't hold all types of coffee, sometimes I had water coming out from the sides, or straight into tray. And I suspect that the pressure is not sustainable because I'm getting different results - sometimes coffee is good, sometimes you just can't drink this."
"They actually only ship one Pad to me, even though their title is ""Ampad Evidence Dual Pads, Legal Size, Canary Yellow, Legal Ruling, 100 Sheets per Pad, 6 Pads per Pack (20-247)"""
"I agree with the other reviewer. I bought all of the books in this series and am shocked at how much of the advice has been taken from previous authors on these topics. She is copying classics like Emily Post and simply re-wording the text. Except for the cute drawings, this series is a waste of money. If you want to know how to do things ""correctly"", read Letitia Baldridge's ""The New Manners For the '90's"". It covers everything and is written by a woman with the education and experience to know of which she speaks! Not someone who using her fashion connections to flood the magazines and talk shows with her ""discovery"" of this information."
"I got this with Spirit Camera and I have to say that was a nice way to crash course into the series. Seriously, its scary and even though you have a sister near you, its unnerving. Anyway, you'll enjoy this if you are looking for a scary story to play through."
"I started working with this book hoping to get a good idea of how todeploy my applications with BEA. The product was very simple toinstall and deploy, but the server won't stay up when I startaccessing the site....The book was OK, but to much hype on theserver...."
"I bought this item to use under a poodle skirt. Well, it didnt do anything. I was expecting a poofier underskirt, but what I got was basically a skirt made out of tulle. It's not even slightly poofy. And when I put it under the skirt, it wasn't even even so it made my hips look all uneven and bumpy. I can't send it back, so I'm stuck with it. The stretchy part is made of some kind of crappy pseudo silk. Super cheap. Super unsexy. Pass on this item and go with something else."
"the recipies in this book are plain and uninspired. they are also inexact. in the recipie for Tuna Noolde Casarole it calls for a bag of pasta. What type of pasta? How big a bag. I put a 1 lb bag of egg noodles in and tried to put it in the recomended size container, didn't fit. The sauce is also not nearly enough for the quantity (if you use 1 lb of egg noodles)."
After I read the reviews and purchased this product. I expected to have to do the fix using an empty k-cup as recommended by others. I had even saved and prepared the empty k-cup. Unfortunately it was a waste of time and money. After following directions for fix carefully. Coffee was still to weak and grounds still in coffee! I would not recommend this product.
"My new Dimage Z2, just suffered power failure (Purchased Apr 26th). KonincaMinolta does not have local service center and according to their customer service repair volume is so high on this camera that turn around time is 3-4 weeks.You have to pay for shipping the camera, and they will send similarly by ground (add to the cost of purchasing this camera).Besides this I have found that auto focus fails in low light - auto focus does not really works. Manual focusing procedure is so cumbersome that it may as well not be there.I regret buying Minolta, better stick with Cannon A80 - better product better value. And I am long time Minolta user from 400si to 600si (SLR cameras)."
This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. I am even a Tom Green fan so I went in with an open mind expecting Greene's ususal antics. This movie is so unfunny I wanted to turn it off less than thirty minutes after the opening credit. Don't waste an hour and a half of your life on this piece of garbage.
"My husband gave me the Kindle for my birthday and it was the best gift he ever gave me (for my birthday). Even better than my laptop! I have arthritis in my hands so holding books has been painful for me. The Kindle is lighter and easier to hold than a book, and I am so happy to be able to read, read, read. Thanks, honey, for the wonderful 58th gift you've given me for my birthday. Now you all can figure out when I met my husband, and how old I am!"
"Screws did not fit in the pre-drilled holes. Luckily I had the proper sizes in my tool kit. The seat is put together, but after 4 hours I have put it aside and will tackle the steps at another time. I wish that I had gone out and purchased one that was already assembled. I am out of the money, and I still do not have a kitchen stool! It's too heavy to think about returning, and like most people, I had to totally tear up the packaging to get it out of the box. It can't be returned. So, there it sits, over in the corner! I ran out of screws that would fit the holes but I have the ones that came with the stool. Maybe I will find a use for them You will get 4 screws and 12 bolts.Have your 16 screws ready before you begin. Save the 24 bolts for another job"
This is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen! From beginning to end there is never a dull moment. definetly worth watching.
"very good... not just typical big beat stuff, rather, electronic of all sorts.. much more expansive than other artists in same tech-popular genre."
The plot moves along very slowly.Pages and pages go by without much happening.A lot of repetitions also. The author would keep repeatingthe same thing over and over. She like to say thing again even though she said it earlier. (see how annoying that can get???)
"I bought this product because I was looking for a low-cost solution to some data-loss issues. I found that it is pretty effective at retrieving many deleted files, and does a better job than many other low-cost or free programs of this type. It even allows you to preview the files before restoring them. However, I am quite disappointed by the fact that the program cannot restore the original file and folder structures, or even the original names of the files themselves, which can create a great deal of confusion when it comes to sorting the restored files. Therefore, if these issues are of concern to you, I would recommend spending a bit more if necessary to buy software that provides these features."
"My little girl who is two can't get enough of Miss Pattycake, and it is such a blessing to see her jump and clap and praise the Lord with the songs as she watches!"
"Diane Lane is the only reason to watch this movie. As an actor, she knows how to create a meat pie out of potatoes. Unfortunately, she is also the reason why this 'trip down gore lane' can pass itself off as a serious film at first glance. It is, however, just another exercise in how far a filmmaker can push the envelope on the theme of cruelty, mayhem and murder. The only favorable point I can possibly give it is that the producers did not shy away from using an actress who, thankfully, is not trying to hide her age and is accepting the cycle of life with a grace that makes her even lovelier."
does the job although unsightly and has provided a sturdy base for the umbrella which is permenantly up and will not retract during evenings or breeze.
"This budget-priced laser printer is quiet and delivers your documents most expeditiously! Note to Macintosh OS X users: the latest driver can be downloaded from the manufacturer's website so you won't have to revert to OS 9 whenever you need to print. Hopefully this will save you some time and trouble, because there were no editorial comments or customer reviews before I purchased this! I selected four stars because there is a slight pause after issuing the command to print, but the pause is negligible and hardly worth mentioning."
"This is a must-have for dog owners and fanciers alike! I bought this with my birthday money, and the humorous text urged me to snatch it from the shelves. It's a book to read when in the bowels of ""Dog Ownwer Despair"". If you love or like dogs, this is a book you NEED to have!"
"Four women ahead of their time. Their album, Fanny Hill has some of my favorite songs- ever. I like their rendition of Bulldog, almost better than the Beatles. 'You Have a Home' is one of the most beautiful songs- the message is very poignant- most single mothers can relate. Listen to 'Ain't That Peculiar and I bet you become a fan."
I got his for my son's room and I was very disappointed with my purchase. the color of the drapes was really dull and it didn't cover my window fully. Also the things used to hold the drapes together didn't have a good design
"My favorite band of the 60's but very poor sound quality makes this disc not worth the $40.00 or so I paid for it.But being a big Blue Cheer fan I have something that not many people own.If you don't own anything by this groundbreaking group,buy Vincebus Eruptum,you won't be disappointed!"
"audio does not work, have a pioneer sc57 receiver and a pioneer BDP53 blu-ray player with updated software.any advice on how to fix"
"The Chesapeake Bay area surrounding Annapolis is a wonderful place to live. The author of this medical fantasy story describes local neighborhoods and live experiences with focused accuracy. There is much to learn about piloting an airplane that is revealed by the author's vast knowledge of that subject but the relevance to the whole story escaped me. Perhaps, one must rise above all the details on the surface of the earth to see the whole picture and make such a seemingly simple but amazing medical discovery. The greatest asset of this book is to remind readers that helping mankind is much more important than the potential monitary reward associated with an invention or a discovery. The second most important asset of this book is the pure learning experience about historical facts from a very learned author."
"This book, which claims to be an introduction to the world's religions,spends 2/3 of its time discussing the development of Christianity. Even if the potential reader is a non-Christian or a Christian who seeks to rationalize Christianity with reason, this book has many errors and off-the-wall remarks which are misleading. For the Christian who basically holds to all the truth of the Bible, you are much better off consulting other books for knowledge about the other religions of the world."
"Was so disappointed when I opened the box from Amazon today! I actually ordered these in 3 different colors, thinking they were actual blank book-type notebooks that I could include with gifts. Thought they were special-priced on clearance. NOT SO. The price of $1.50 is actually printed on the back, and they are really small and kind of chintzy looking. Definitely not what I thought I was getting. Should definitely be listed as notepads, not notebooks."
"It was an okay book I suppose. It sagged during the middle. I am in Andrea's fiction writers support group, and she is not a very nice person. She puts others down, so that may have cast a shadow over it for me."
"The Garmin Streetpilot C330 is sure one neat little invention. Use it around town or on a long road trip, you will not be disappointed. No need for lengthy instructions. Most people can figure out how to use it right out of the box. No set up is required. You can set it to find an address, find the name of a restaurant, or a hotel. You can ask it to find you food by category such as Italian, fast, and many more choices. It will give you a list from closest to furthest away. Same with lodging. It will give the phone numbers of the choices too. I am a trucker and have found it invaluable to my daily job. Once in awhile it might be off by a few house numbers, but it has no problem getting you on the right street. A great buy!"
"In 2001 ""Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture"" received the prestigious Bancroft Prize for American history from Columbia University.In October 2002 the author, Michael Bellesiles, resigned as a professor at Emory University, after an independent panel of scholars strongly critized his research, saying that he was ""guily of unprofessional and misleading work.""In December 2002 Columbia rescinded their award to Bellesiles; in a statement issued by the school's trustees, they said that Bellesiles' ""book had not and does not meet the standards ... established for the Bancroft Prize.""An online search will quickly and easily verify that the above information is true - something that sadly cannot be said of many of the ""facts"" contained in Bellesiles' book.Whatever your views on gun control may be, avoid ""Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture"" like the plague - it has clearly and widely been discredited as bad, bad, bad history."
"I hope he retires for good this time because I am getting tired of looking at his ugly face and weak music.This cd is really weak and pathetic because it sounds boring just like all the rest of his albums.The music is very pop accompanied by weak beats and weak rapping.He raps about the same thing that all rappers rap about money,clothes,cars,hoes.All in all I hope he stays retired because he is one weak rapper.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!"
"I never got my purchase, never got a mail telling that the were returning the slides, so I think this is not a serious shop and Amazon is losing points with their clients."
"Am happy with this purchase, My wife tried these on and the size and width were perfect, its amazing the amount of work that go""s into these boots, the company uses quality material and workmanship and yet charges awesome prices that makes it easy for anyone to own a pair of boots from propet, am very happy with this purchase and Happy Wife means Happy Life lol !"
Peelers on the market today are of a poor quality so I was happy to see a more sturdy design. I was disappointed however. It bearly peeled carrots and I tried different angles to be sure.
"This wonderful little book offers many choices for mealtime blessings that are especially appropriate to thank our Provider and Source for the daily bread that graces our tables. As we increase our connection to the Divine Spirit, one will find blessings to suit any and all occasions whether eating alone, with others, or in a restaurant. This collection of blessings is a gift of love!"
This is a subject I have always been interested in. I think the book covers the struggle for the city very well. From the grewsome deaths from starvation to the breakdown of food supplies to the fighting itself.
These items are selling for different prices--It seems like whatever popular colors are they jack up the price--what a cheat!
"Where are the good writers? What was this supposed to be? If you like a contrived plot, cardboard characters, stupid dialogue, you will love this movie. Alright, the scenary was wonderful, hence the two stars."
"I found this movie extremely dull and laughed exactly one time. The ""comedy,"" if you really want to call it that, is beyond juvenile... and not even the funny juvenile humor that makes other movies good. Overused accents are very rarely funny, especially when they're so over accentuated (like in this film) that it gets to be annoying. How so many people liked this movie is beyond me, but it makes me think about how bad society is becoming."
"Seven hours each way for Thanksgiving... oh yes, love the headphones! Would have been a much different trip without them."
"Pattern matches my dish set. They are durable and the lids stay on. I have washed mine in the dishasher, but not the lids. Sometimes plastic warps and I want the lids to keep fitting. They stack and store nicely inside each other which is a spacesaver."
"I could not get the CD side of this Dual disc to play in my computer, or stanard CD players including my original SONY CD player from the early 1980s. The DVD side works however works flawlessly."
"Sounds like a fascinating book....but what if no one ever landed on the moon? Because if they did so many years ago, why have current space programmes never repeated this....and what about the radiation belt around the planet??"
Thought this was a how to book to playing video poker. Instead it was the author bragging about how good he was at the game. Boring!!!!!!
"This was the first Koontz novel I ever read and I could not put it down. The depiction of the characters and images seen through the eyes of Chris Snow was incredible. As the book neared the end I found myself wishing for it not to be over. I felt like I was right there going through the ordeal myself. Koontz pulled me in and has not let me go. I have read several other great books by him since, but none of them hooked me like Seize the Night."
"I found this book to do just what I had hoped. It's like a syllabus from a very smart, highly organized professor, who fleshes out the subjects just enough, and lets you know where exactly to look for more. It's concise, intelligent, and informative, and it saved me a lot of time in working out an outline on the subject (I'm an art professor myself). Cynthia Freeland -- thank you! What clarity!"
"The basis of the story was good, but the editing was awful. it should have been in chronological order so we didn't have to see every scene 4 times, and if they didn't have a commercial every 8 min, then maybe it wouldn't have been 4 parts. it could have been a winner."
"it's OK if you are buying it for small kid. Easy assembly, good look, Kid loves it. but, This is for very small kid and may not last for 2 to 3 years for growing kid. Although it has adjustable seat but not very balanced after much height. I would rather have little bigger than this one."
"This fax machine needs a babysitter. It cannot be trusted to fax without trying to eat the pages and jam constantly. You have to stand over it, and guide the pages straight so they don't get pulled in crooked. And it is LOUD!! VERY LOUD!! I dream of taking this machine out to the field, pulling out a baseball bat and going all OFFICE SPACE on it!!!!"
"What a waste of money. This is NOT an LED light, and does not come close to the performance of an LED light at half the price! Guess we're paying for the name and the lifetime warranty. This one will easily last a lifetime, sitting unused in a drawer. Bought it for my medical career wife (she likes purple) but it is clumsy for her to turn on, concentrate the beam, then turn off with one hand. Bought her a 99-cent tear-drop shaped keychain LED light on a whim and its perfect. Brighter and easier to use, replaceable battery, and 1/7 the cost. I really expected more from this company, but both this light and their customer perspective are obsolete. No complaint with the quality of construction. Solid aluminum and O-rings as usual. Just has the minor flaw of casting a weak and scattered beam, way below the performance of modern LED technology. The light is yellow and full of shadow artifacts that prevent a clean illumination. Not a good buy; don't repeat my mistake!"
"I have seen this movie before and I enjoyed it, that's why I ordered it, to add to my collection. I could not view this when I got it. It says INVALID REGION CODE and would not play, I don't know what that means I've never had the problem before viewing a movie. I just wasted my money on this since I can't watch it."
"I've been on it for a week now and I'm going to stop taking it. It does help to go softer, but I'm only going once a day now..instead of my usual 2 or 3. I took it because it promised a good cleaning out. I'm getting the opposite and this can't be good for me. I give it 2 stars because the pills are easy to swallow and I notice I sleep better at night. Something in it must be causeing that. Overall, I wasted my money."
"Please do not waste your money on this. It is terrible, slow, and boring. I am extremely disappointed."
"I thought this would be a nice cookbook to have since I am new to cast iron cooking. I found I really have not used it though.I seem to just make things on my own, but there are a couple recipes I'd like to try sometime."
"I bought this tv refurbished from phillps outlet. It looked great. great picture. Worked for 2 days!!! Then same as others will not turn on, flashing red light. nothing works! Called factory service waiting for them to get back in touch with me. since no repair sites are within 50 miles of me, they cant have anyone come to fix it. I am out of there operating radius. Do not buy spend the extra money on a better tv!"
"Joss Stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. I couldn't find a single memorable tune here. I also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, ""Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew."" I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's ""The Orange Album"" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut. Had Gwen Stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. It's new artists like Stefy that could keep the music business afloat. Are we listening Ms. Stone."
"My daughter loves doing science experiments so I got her this kit thinking it would be an excellent teaching tool. Boy, was I wrong. The kit DOES NOT come with everything needed to do the experiments and some of the random things included in the kit are not even used in the experiments. This was a big waste of money not to mention how disappointed my daughter was. I would definately NOT recommend this kit for anyone."
"Werewolf was my first introduction to World of Darkness. I enjoyed it, but, reading the other books pointed out to me that Werewolves are definitely a better platform for Storytellers than players - they're either too weak or too powerful! New players will find themselves darting away from a vampire or hunter with any kind of experience, where as someone who actually finds standing in the Garou nation will be able to kill off Justicars and Femorachs without breaking a sweat.You could play a campaign, of course, but, it'll take some effort to make high-leveled characters keep interest. Buyer beware!"
"This controller is terrible. The only positive thing I could say about this controller is you can throw it at the wall and it won't break. The sticks are hard to move and don't allow for the pressure sensitivity required for enjoyable gaming. The buttons are stiff. The handles are big and uncomfortable. The included headset is uncomfortable to a grown adult. I didn't use the included headset after the first night. Overall, I would say move on to the next after market controller."
Gives the reader a wonderful and clear picture of how Egypt has changed throughout history. I send a thank you to the author.
"This is one of those ""great shows"" from my childhood and it was a lot of fun to revisit it after all these years. Its really good that the price has dropped by about half however, I mean seriously.... This sure isn't Hamlet. The show is cheesy and cheap, but not in a bad way at all. I found it quite entertaining still. And it is really a treat to see the eternally classy and beautiful Lee Meriwether at what is perhaps the pinnacle of her elegance and grace.The show is more serious then, and far less classic then, Lost in Space or Batman. But it provides the same type of wholesome campy entertainment that has made those shows TV legends. If you don't like cheese however, look elsewhere."
"It's nicely built, very fast thanks to it's F/1.4 and has very smooth and quite autofocus.As most of reviews noted, it is very soft in the corners when stopped down but with this kind of lens, you don't really care for the edges, especially as you get a wider angle than most of it's competitors in the category.I am very pleased with it, but if you are looking for a good portrait lens i would recommend the CANON 50mm F/1.4 instead.it will be much sharper at corners and will cost less."
"As a musician, I actually bought this to use when I play outdoor concerts to keep the music on the stand instead of using paper clips on windy days. Works like a charm!"
"I purchased the liner to match the shower curtain both 96 inches. The liner came shorter! It is good quality plastic, nice and thick and the gromlets are strong too - but why so short?"
i never really got into rpgs my friends got me to play vampire once or twice but it was boring and i played wraith whcih was cool because of the great war expansion but this has to be the best rpg ever most of my friends and me loved the card game and we developed our own storyline for our campaign form the card game it was very fun and we had a huge battle at beiden pass that rivaled the scorpion clan coup this game is great
"Came to Amazon so I can send the product link to a friend, decided to write a review.Love this product, it just works and never gives us problems."
"Purchased 5/4/07...rec'd shortly thereafter. Washed blender and got ready to use same day. Today, 6/13/07 attempted to use it for the FIRST TIME, but it will NOT start!!! Insane for such a pricey blender!!! Now must start the process of returning it...."
The cartridge is faulty. It leaves a ghost image that transfers to the paper. I called to request a refund or exchange. They said they would send return instructions within 24 to 48 hours. I'm still waiting 3 days later.
"This book is utterly useless for both a beginner like me, and someone who knows C++ well. All it does is explain what each function does rather than teaching you how to use it. In the 2nd chapter alone, there's a 200-line program of all OpenGL functions that you're expected to understand by about 3 pages of explanation. I'm a beginning programmer who knows a lot about C, but not everything, and this book isn't helping me at all. Also, I can tell that it doesn't teach you much, as the end of book game example is slow and buggy. Go learn C++ then get an online tutorial or reference page, don't waste the money on this book."
"I'm a little troubled by most of the reviews that I've seen for Groundation. It seems that all of these ""real reggae fans"" have overlooked the fact that this album is average at best. Bob, Steel Pulse, Midnite, Luciano, Don Carlos, we could go on forever, there is just too much GOOD reggae out there. Unfortunately ""We Free Again"" and everything else I've heard from Groundation just does not live up to the hype you'll see here in these reviews. Seriously, even John Brown's Body is better. Check out Midnite's RAS MEK PEACE if you want to hear some REAL reggae. I mean if you like Groundation, you'll wet your pants when you hear Midnite.if you want ""the real thing."""
"This is not a high-brow comedy, but neither is it the typical low-brow stuff being produced today that focuses on bodily functions and groin punches. This is British comedy, which means that it actually has some wit, in between the sight gags. If the comedy of Peter Sellers, the absurdity of Monty Python, and the sheer outlandishness of the Rocky Horror Picture Show appeal at all to you, then this movie will tickle at least one funny bone."
"This book has many helpful, fun and task specific activities that work for children during their most formative years. I have found this book to be invaluable. The games are beneficial for teaching and reinforcing specific skills, and they are entertaining enough to keep kids interested. Most of all, the games really work! The games don't take much time or extreme effort, but they pay off extremely well. If you are the parent or teacher of young children, you will find yourself referring to this book again and again."
"Actually, I find the argument that these books should be judged simply on their own terms to be absurb, especially since the fabrication of JT Leroy was used to lure readers to the books in the first place. In other words, the books are fiction but the marketing device to get us to read them was a lie, pure and simple. So that's how these writings by Laura Albert should be understood--not as a stand-alone works of fiction but as a marketing tool to fool the public into buying them. If the hoax of JT Leroy shouldn't matter in regard to the books than why, I wonder, was it used in the first place?"
"The plastic wrapper melted onto the item & would notcome off. Not pleased, I wouldn't have item shipped in thesummer."
"The price was good and delivery excellent. The reason for buying this item is my old straps are looking like failure could be imminent.Always be prepared. PS: This is a simple design that kicks the behind. A creative guy can build his own mounting system for a number of things with these straps. For me, it was an elevated head lamp for use with a Works Enduro Rider steering dampener."

"for a long time, there wasn't a lot of asia video out there. then came some bootlegs, then the music videos and concerts in russia and europe. finally....a concert that spans the entire musical careers of all the members!!! it is so nice to see and hear songs from yes, king crimson, elp, and even...the buggles. for me, the highlight was asia doing a monster version of ""fanfare for the common man"". the band truly seemed to enjoy the variety of material, as well as all the classic asia songs. would have liked to see ""go"" played, but that is covered in other collections. i like steve howe, but pat thrall actually did a nice job in his asia stint. palmer is palmer....the king! downes is a creative force, and wetton has been one of my favorite vocalists since the 70's. asia fans....this is a MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Theodora Philcox has created a very helpful book on the still life. There is a wide range of styles and several very fine artists. Philcox takes the artists' own explanations of their techniques and adds some of her own helpful comments and observations. Styles of art are juxtaposed giving the reader a good view of different approaches to their art. Of special interest is the work of artist Timothy C. Tyler whose realistic and brushy artwork steals the show.
"I bought a lot of Dance, Trance, Electronic, CD and this is my favorite album for 2006. Very good beat and vocal. A good choice for Club Hits fan..."
it is fairly well known that many fans of the show are not little kids. As such how can this outrage continue what is the point of releasing a dvd without a widescreen format? I won't even buy this mockery of a release. They release B-horror movies in widescreen so why not the Powerpuff Girls movie?
"I'm very disappointed in this product. It was difficult to calibrate, and not very accurate once I did get it calibrated. It lasted only a few months. My advice: spend more than ten bucks on a meat thermometer."
"I also had a scare with my 10 month old that woke up at 3 am crying hysterically b/c she was trapped under the ultimate crib sheet, however I also realized that she would likely not suffocate because the fabric is a high tech breathable fabric that prevents suffocation. However, we still removed the crib sheets."
"This mat is definately worth the extra money. I practiced yoga five days a week for 4 months, blowing out one cheaper mat and causing significant signs of wear on the second one. Once this mat is broken in, I found it to not only be quite sticky, but also to provide excellent cushioning for me knees. It is also larger than most other mats, so there is less need to read just your position on the mat as frequently to avoid contact with others in a crowded yoga class.This mat is also excellent for those wanting to practice yoga at home on carpet. My other mats always slid around on my carpetted floor, but this one is heavy enough to stay put. If you are committed to a yoga practice, invest in this mat and you won't regret it. The only negative is that it is so heavy I would not necessarily recommend it to yogis that walk or bike to class.Namaste!"
"This is an accurate and durable weight. I have read numerous articles about free weights being off. I weighed mine and they were accurate. The only thing that kept them from getting five stars is that they are on the bulky side likely due to the neoprene coating. I am female 5'7"" with long thin fingers. If my fingers were not on the longer side it may be hard to grip these well. They work for me, but I would be careful if you have tiny hands."
"While this CD set is in a very nice carrying case with a magnetic clasp, and the sound is clear, unfortunately the background music (with an ocassion drum beat etc) is distracting, and, and for me personally, the person narrating it has a 'southern preacher' sound that I don't care for. If you prefer a southern preacher reading this and background music then you will really enjoy this. I'm used to Alexander Scourby with no music/dramatization, so this was a let down for me."
"The design is nice, the mechanics a little awkward, the tape drive is funky, and the remote is flimsy but the SOUND, oh, my, the SOUND is wonderful. It's far better than my $250 Sony and better overall than any other stereo that I've owned.I know, I know, it's hard to believe a $50 stereo sounds great but this one does. Try it in the store, if you can. I'm not sure how or why it sounds so much better than everything else available for less than $250 but it does."
The writer is trying to make an issue between the main characters so that they have that perfect moment where she realized he is the most important. Give me a break. write some good movies and step out of the box of writing the same plot all the time.
"I thought that this would be a great little camera to show off my new house before and after. Well I was wrong. First the batteries run out constantly and second, the software is not compatible with XP. This is not helpful. I guess that the adage you get what you pay for applies here."
"I'm working on my PhD in Geography. This was a required text for a first-year graduate seminar on ""History and Theory of Geography"". This book gives a biographical sketch of numerous recent luminaires in Geography. The book is easy to read because it's broken down into nice nuggets of information about a specific Geographer and makes mention of how their work relates to other Geographers also in the book. Granted, it's not comprehensive, but it does give a good foundation in the theories behind modern Geography.If you are into Geography (with a capital-G) and not just geography, buy this book. Even if you don't read it right away, it'll find a comfortable spot on your bookshelf."
"Vince Vaughn should be Pete Tyler! Keanu Reeves might be okay, too, but Vince Vaughn would be better. John Cusask already played the guy in 'High Fidelity' who was a loser, by the way, and Pete Tyler is much cooler and better boyfriend material. Everyone should read this book 'cause it's great and then write Vince Vaughn and tell him to do the movie!"
"Gritty, dirty and downright manly. The overgrown adolescents of today need to study this film and learn how to act like a man. No tattoos, ear-rings or other piercings to smother the Y gene. Little music is used; some of the 40s and 50s flicks were embellished with over the top, histrionic scores combating rather than complimenting the plot. The dialogue is short, cutting and to the point. I especially like the ""he-girl"" comment. Another William Wellman masterpiece; get this film. DVD transfer is superb."
"The handle on the kettle is not connected very well and allows for a lot of ""bounce"" when you are lifting the kettle, traditionally instability is not something I look for when poring boiling water. Also, when you lift the lid you need to lift it from the top of the kettle and then immediately move it to the left or the right, since there isn't enough clearance (b/c of the handle) to remove the lid naturally.The color is nice and they did a nice job on the ombre effect. I expected more from Le Creuset."
"This documentary was co-produced and directed by Israelis and Palestinians. It presents an in-depth view of efforts by people from both sides toward mutual understanding. Full of stories that we should all hear, but don't. A must-see for anyone interested in peace in the region."
"If you truly enjoy great coffee, this coffeemaker is the one! I have never tasted such good coffee made in someone's home and rarely even at fine restaurants. I feel like I'm at Starbuck's everyday even when I don't grind my own beans. I almost bought the regular Mill and Brew and I'm so glad I waited and got the carafe minus the heating element. You may have to tweak the coffee to water ratio but be patient Grasshopper - it is so worth it!"
"Want to know how to stop a movie from looping? Not here. How about getting transitions to run smoothly? Nah.If you haven't a clue what Director is about - walk away; this book will not help you. It assumes much too much of the reader. On the other hand, once you have some idea of the Director paradigm and have made a movie or two, then I would add this to your bookshelf."
"Although Laurie did grab me from the beginning and take a wild ride, I soon lost interest in the book. I don't know if it was the cast of characters showing up after a 100 page hiatus or if it was just way the story was being told. Eventually, I sent down the book and never finished it."
Very clever layout and easy to understand recipes. The beautiful photos make a snap to imagine cooking these things yourself. Highly recommended!
"I just got these and opened them about 10 minutes ago. I was a bit unsure about getting them, what with the 1 star reviews, but I thought what the hell and took a chance. I have to say I am glad - 1 star reviewers must have strange ears as as well as being comfortable, they have a great sound. I am on pretty low volume and I can't hear the keys as I type. The design is great - they fit fine, and they are almost unnoticable."
"I think this book is a all right type of book. I know life has its struggles, but there is nothing worth running away from. I believe it was a couldn't keep the book down group, but I believe nothing is worth running away from."
"This iron cuts my ironiong time in half. It is easy to use, outperforms every iron I've ever used, and makes the task of ironing fun and rewarding. What other small appliance can you say that about?"
"I have looked and analised the book, and compared with the Peppin Press books, this book is all you need to learn and study packaging design.This book will teach me and maybe you how we can design packaging.All cash deserved"
"The same work conducted by Klempeler with Philharmonia Orchestra is famous. But I promise this live recording is better and it's the best one I've heard(including Walter,Bernstein,Rattle,Mehta,Kaplan and other Klem's one). Klempeler's reading is insightful and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra played so warm and powerful that I think it is better than the philharminia orchestra especially for its brass. The remastering of this disc is succesful,the sound is more rich than other version. Though there's several cough-sound,it's never mind.I'll give it 6 star if i could."
Very informative and well written. When I started reading this I had no idea how exciting cereal was. It is very comparable to the personal computer revolution of the 1980s. A true history of Americana that seems to been forgotten in our times (2004).
